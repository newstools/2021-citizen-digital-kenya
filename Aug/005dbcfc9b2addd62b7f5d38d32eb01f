FKF Premier League leaders Tusker FC are now targeting maximum points from their five remaining matches as they hunt for their first league title since 2016, coach Robert Matano has said. This is after they wasted an opportunity to widen the gap at the summit of the Kenyan Premier League, going down 0-1 to a hard-fighting Nairobi City Stars at Ruaraka Grounds on Friday. “We are aiming for the 15 remaining points, that is all we are after, so that we meet our season’s target,” said Matano. Tusker could have been dispatched from the top of the log by close competitors KCB FC, but the latter also suffered a shock 0-2 defeat against Posta Rangers on the same day. The experienced Matano has also played down the notion that the absence of their former captain Hashim Sempala who moved to Kabwe Warriors of Zambia cost them the game. He instead  blamed his midfield for the  few chances created in the match. Miscommunication amongst their backline which led to the first goal, another area of improvement before facing the Andre Casa Mbungo coached Bandari.

The Brewers will be travelling down to Coast to face shaky Bandari FC on Wednesday at Mbaraki. The Dockers were humiliated 4-1 by Nzoia in their last match. Matano is likely to welcome back the duo of Henry Juma and Boniface Muchiri who have been with the Emerging Stars in the CECAFA Under 23 tournament in Ethiopia where Kenya finished fourth. With five rounds of matches remaining, Tusker are leading with 55 points, one ahead of KCB who will be playing Western Stima with their opponents Bandari occupying position 8 with 40 points.
