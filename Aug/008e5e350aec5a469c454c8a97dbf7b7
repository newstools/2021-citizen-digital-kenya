Nzoia Sugar FC tactician Ibrahim Shikanda is confident his side will bag maximum points when they take on leaders Tusker in an FKF Premier League fixture on Wednesday. Nzoia are fighting relegation while Tusker lead the table with 61 points with two games to go and Shikanda knows how dangerous it can be to lose the two remaining matches at this crucial time. The brewers will be guaranteed the title on Wednesday if they get maximum points at Sudi stadium and second-placed KCB loses to AFC Leopards on the same day. Nzoia FC are a point above relegation while the Robert Matano’s charges Tusker are atop the standings with 61 points, three ahead of KCB. “We are going for the maximum points and nothing less, my boys are in good spirits, we have worked on finishing power and we want to get good results that will put us in a better position on the log.” “We don’t want to start worrying about relegation more especially at this crucial stage. We are leaving nothing to chance, we have to win the remaining two matches,” Shikanda told Citizen Digital.
