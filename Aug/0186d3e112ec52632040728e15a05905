Victor Kipchirchir Rotich has won the first edition of the Machakos 15km Great Run with his counterpart Jackline Chelal clinching victory in the women’s race. Both winners are from Uasin Gishu County. Kipchirchir, who won the Eldoret City Marathon three months ago, timed 41.51.43 for his victory ahead of Emmanuel Bor (42.04.86) and Raynald Kipkorir 42.27.45 who finished second and third respectively. Chelal, the third finisher in Eldoret who trains in Iten, clocked 48.48.65 for a dominant win with Sharon Kemboi (49.23.47) and Pauline Eskon (49.29.10) sealing the podium places. “I was well prepared because I knew I’d find tough competitors here and I’m really proud of my effort. Now I want to enjoy the win and then my manager and I will decide where next,” Kipchirchir said after the race. On her part, Chelal said victory had surpassed her expectation on the day as she was competing over that distance for the first time. She is due to race at the Madrid Marathon next month. Leaky Kamina from Makueni won 10km event with Pauline Kavata taking the corresponding women’s race. Also Read:  SELECTED RESULTS Men (15k)
