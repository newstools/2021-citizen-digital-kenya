The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) has opened investigations into the death of a man who is alleged to have been shot and killed by police in Kahawa West, Kiambu County on Wednesday morning. The deceased is reported to have been fatally shot as police responded to contain demonstrations by area residents who were protesting kiosk demolitions. The traders claim their stalls were demolished early morning without notice by officers from the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS). Transport and business operations along the main road to Kahawa West from Kiambu Road was paralysed as the irate traders took to the streets to protest. IPOA Chairperson Anne Makori said the authority will seek to establish whether the death falls within the Authority’s mandate of holding police accountable for their actions. “Further, the Authority has also dispatched a Monitoring Team to observe how the police conduct the management of the demonstrations. Upon conclusion, if culpability will be found, IPOA will make appropriate recommendations to the relevant State agencies and also upraise the public on its findings,” she said in a statement.
