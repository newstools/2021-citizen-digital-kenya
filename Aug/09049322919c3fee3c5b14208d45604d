KCB forward Derrick Otanga has been named the June Premier League (FKF-PL) player of the month after seeing off competition from three other contestants. Otanga was instrumental in KCB’s unbeaten run in June where the Bankers won three and drew one of their four league games, narrowly missing out on the CAF Champions League slot that went to Tusker FC. During the month, KCB picked a total of 10 points from a possible 12 with Otanga solely earning his side six by scoring two winning goals. He opened the month with the lone goal in the 1-0 win over Bidco United at Thika Stadium on June 16 and three days later he scored as KCB registered another 1-0 win over Mathare United at Ruaraka Grounds. By the end of the month, KCB was just a point behind the Brewers. The former Wazito and Sony Sugar player’s good run with the Zedekiah Otieno coached team saw him beat two of his teammates; Nashon Alembi and Joseph Okoth to the award. The pair came in second and third respectively, ahead of the other nominee – Gor Mahia keeper Gad Mathews. Also Read: The award comes with Sh. 50,000 cash reward and a personalised trophy.
