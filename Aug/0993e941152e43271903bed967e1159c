General Service Unit (GSU) clinched a record-stretching 14th Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) men’s title on Sunday after topping the playoffs at the Makande Social Hall in Mombasa. The paramilitary side edged out their bitter rivals Kenya Prisons 3-1 in the final match to finish on eight points and defend their crown for the third time in a row. The clash had been billed as an explosive affair and it duly lived up with the Gideon Tarus-coached side emerging winners with sets of 25-21, 18-25, 25-17 and 25-14 to continue their stranglehold on a league they have dominated since 2016. Speaking to Citizen Digital, head coach Tarus said his squad was strong and was confident of defending his title despite missing crucial star Abiud Chirchir, who is currently turning out for Grand Nancy of France. “My boys perfectly executed the duty very well and we never lost our focus even after our opponents snatched the second set. We were determined and we never bothered about how Prisons had played their first two matches. “We’ve dominated the local scene for long and it’s about time we go for the African glory,” said Tarus, who is also the national men’s team head coach.
