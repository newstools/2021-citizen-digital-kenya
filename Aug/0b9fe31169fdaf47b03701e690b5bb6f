Deputy President William Ruto has downplayed the recent controversial move by government to swap General Service Unit (GSU) officers guarding his residences with Administration Police Service officers, terming the matter a non-issue. DP Ruto, who spoke at a church service on Sunday, said the nation should not waste a lot of time debating the issue as it is inconsequential and instead focus on moving forward. The DP stated that he does not mind even being guarded by G4S officers, saying GSU officers should protect Kenyans and the country at large hence if that is the purpose for which they were redeployed then he has no problem. “We will make sure the nation is firm…wakulima wanatafuta…hii mambo ya GSU, AP ni mambo madogo sana tusipoteze wakati…Sina shida na AP wakikuja kusimamia mahali naishi…wale GSU kama kazi imepatikana ili Wakenya wapate usalama wacha wasaidie Wakenya pale,” he said, “Wanaweza leta hata G4S, there is no problem…tusilete migawanyiko kwa askari…tuache siasa duni….wale wanajitafutia nani mkubwa nani mdogo, haya hayasaidii changamoto zilizoko kwa Wakenya…priorities ni kujua wafanyibiashara wanapata fedha wapi.” The DP also rubbished calls from a section of the political class, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, for him to resign from the Jubilee government over his alleged dissatisfaction with its operations.
