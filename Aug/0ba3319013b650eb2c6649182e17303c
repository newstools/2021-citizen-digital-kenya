Equity Bank head coach David Maina says maintaining their top spot is the ultimate goal as they bid to win yet another basketball women league title. The Bankers are the defending champions and will be aiming for back-to-back titles and Maina is aware that keeping the winning momentum is key in attaining this goal. “My expectations are that we maintain the top position because it’s always advantageous in the playoffs especially when we know we are going to meet KPA in the final. Having more games in the playoffs in Nairobi always gives us an upper advantage,” Maina said. At the weekend, Maina’s girls were in imperious form beating fellow giants Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) 64-59 at the University of Nairobi grounds to take their points tally to 14 from seven matches with five games left for them to cap the first leg. Zetech University follow closely at second place on 12 points from an equal number of matches while the Dockers who have played just six games, winning five and losing one are third on 11 points. The experienced tactician added that their weekend match against giants KPA was their best match of the season. Also Read: “The players followed instructions; I think this is the best game they have played this season. For us it was not about winning but we do things right to know where we are and what we need to improve on and so they really did a good job making the technical bench happy,” Maina added. On his part KPA head coach Anthony Ojukwu blamed the defeat on the long break. “The break was too long even though we need to work on our fitness level and I think we need to improve on our execution,” Ojukwu said. KPA had won 52-18 against Eagle Wings on Saturday before their Sunday loss. Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
