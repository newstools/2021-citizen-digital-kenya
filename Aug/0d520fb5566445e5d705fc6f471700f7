Menengai Oilers head coach Gibson Weru is targeting a Kenya Cup play offs semi-final berth as his team prepares to face off with Mwamba RFC on Wednesday 18 August, 2021 at the RFUEA Grounds in a midweek fixture. The Nakuru based side are currently third on the log with 21 points, a point ahead of Strathmore Leos, Masinde Muliro University and Kenya Harlequins. The former rugby 15s scrum half says the top six teams in the log have a chance of  securing the two places in the playoffs up for grabs with Kabras Sugar and KCB RFC having already secured the other two spots. “There is a lot of competition by teams between number two and number six who want to secure a top four finish and qualify for the play offs,” said Weru. “Our goal is to win the match and qualify for the play offs, in terms of preparation we’ve prepared well and the challenge is the short time we have between matches. We played over the weekend then tomorrow and play again this weekend,” explained Weru. However Weru believes that it isn’t easy playing away plus the match congestion with the league matches expected to end this weekend. Also Read: “Playing away is always hard not only for rugby but also in other sports so we know the challenge is there and then the other challenge is in terms of travel and logistics but there is no difference since we’ve prepared well for the match and we’re looking forward to winning the duel,” said Weru. In the other midweek clash Nondescripts will host Resolution Impala Saracens at the Impala Club from 3pm.
