Leading telecoms provider Safaricom saw its share price set yet another new high at the close of trading on Monday. This on the back of news that its recently garnered Ethiopia operating license will include mobile financial services, clearing the way for the expansion of its platform M-Pesa into the country. Safaricom’s share price neared the Ksh.43 mark having been quoted at Ksh.42.95, its highest valuation ever. This to beat its most recent peak at Ksh.42.80 which was posted on July 26. The licensing for its mobile-money platform M-Pesa is expected to follow the granting of a second telecoms operating license by the Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) whose bidding opened last week. Safaricom has continued to break new share price highs this year on positive investor news including its initial Ethiopia telecoms license win and the payment of a first ever interim dividend in February this year.
