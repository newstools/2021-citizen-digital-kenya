Former UNCTAD Secretary General now 2022 presidential hopeful Mukhisa Kituyi was on Tuesday night put to task to explain a video allegedly of himself in a compromising situation that went viral a few months ago. Kituyi, appearing on Citizen TV’s ‘News Night’ show, however declined to give any concrete response on the matter, only coming short of dismissing it saying it has nothing to do with his candidature hence does not warrant any attention. Kituyi promised to run a diligent campaign based on ideals, further stating that he has no dirty tricks up his sleeves for any of his perceived opponents in the run-up to next-year’s polls. Queried by the show host Waihiga Mwaura about the authenticity of the video, he said: “I don’t want to lower the debate of my candidature below my neck. The assets I want to bring to this are; who is Kituyi? What does he stand for in this country? I will sustain a campaign nationally throughout of dignity, respect, even for my opponents, and that’s as much as I want to say about that.” He further rubbished an article published by a local media outlet recently allegedly quoting him blaming the origin and leakage of the said video on his political enemies. “That is a manufactured story, I have not given any such statement to any media outlet or any individual whatsoever,” he stated.
