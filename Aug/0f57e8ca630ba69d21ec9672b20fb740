Lakeside assistant coach Brian Lusaga is worried the long break his team has taken from the Kenya Basketball Premier League will derail them, as they return to action on Saturday. The team faces Equity men’s team in their first match since March this year, and have                                                not undertaken intense training during the break due to demanding COVID-19 protocols. “We are hoping it won’t affect our performance despite being away for long which has resulted in some players adding weight. This is the second week of training because we could not access the venue due to restrictions and also the team being self-sponsored we do struggle to do the covid-19 testing,” he said. Lusaga adds that while away they were involved with corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. “The team embarked on CSR activities because we could not play or train. We did cleaning in children’s homes and also did drug drives for the elderly women in Migori,” he added. On his part Kisumu Lady Bucks coach Michael Dave whose side tackles Equity women’s team Saturday, says they will need to work hard to regain shape after enduring a long spell in the cold, since the government banned sports activities in Western and Nyanza regions.

Before the break, Lakeside had played five games winning one and losing four, while Lady Bucks who are new in the league had played one losing to giants KPA.
