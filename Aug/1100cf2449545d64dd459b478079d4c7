Bandari FC head coach Andre Casa Mbungo says their FKF-PL resurgence has been fueled by players’ good character and backed his side to finish at position three (their current standing on the log). The dockers have won their last two matches by a 2-1 margin, coming from a goal down, the impressive run pushing them to third on the log, behind title contenders Tusker and KCB. Johanna Mwita scored his third goal in three matches equalizing David Odhiambo’s goal before Umar Kasumba scored the winning goal as sports resumed in Bukhungu Stadium following the lifting of social gathering in Lake Region, occasioned by Covid-19 upsurge. “They now have good character which will help us to finish in better position and even to start better next season,” said Casa Mbungo. The Rwandese tactician has at the same time said they need to work on set pieces to avoid future embarrassment as they have conceded goals from free kicks in the last two matches. “Two goals, both from set pieces, I think we need to rectify that in our next matches,” he explained.

Mbungo switched his formation to 3-4-3 in the last two matches and with Iddi’s injury he will be forced to look for new tactics and formations. He said of the player: “He is a young and energetic player, hoping he will help us more as he did against Tusker.” Bandari will welcome on-form Mathare United this weekend at Mbaraki Sports Club before playing away against Sofapaka, and finish their season against Wazito at home in Mombasa.
