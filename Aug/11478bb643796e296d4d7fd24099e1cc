The Moi International Sports Centre Kasarani is ready to host the World Under-20 event set to kick off on August 17-22. Sports Kenya Director General Pius Metto said the renovations at Kenya’s largest stadium are complete, with under two weeks to the start of the event. Metto said the stadium has been classified as a Class 1 facility by the World Athletics giving it the green light to host the global event that will be held in Africa for the first time. “We have been able to undertake refurbishment in and out of the stadium in readiness for the World Under-20 and at the moment I think we are ready to go,” said Metto. Among the key refurbishments undertaken at the facility include the rebranding of seats with the national colours as well as the installation of WI-FI in key areas of the stadium. Metto also explained that they have also put up a fully- equipped gym alongside installing CCTV cameras within the 60,000-seater facility.
