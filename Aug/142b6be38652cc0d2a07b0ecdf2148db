Tadese Worku clinched gold in a championship record of 7:42.09 as compatriot Ali Abdilmana took silver in 7:44.55 while Habtom Samuel of Eritrea rounded the podium in 7:52.69 to bag bronze. Kenya’s Daniel Kinyanjui (8:09.40) finished seventh as Bernard Yegon placed ninth in 8:12.96 Being held for the first time at the World Junior Championships, the men’s 3000m promised to rekindle the rivalry between Kenyans and Ethiopians, two countries that have dominated distance races since time immemorial.

With the Ethiopians stepping on the gas it was now the battle for who will take the bronze medal as Eritreans closed in on Kenyans to take third and fourth positions.
