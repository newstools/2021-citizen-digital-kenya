Premier League side Nairobi City Stars will be out to bounce back from their shock 2-0 loss against Mathare United last week when they host Posta Rangers on Saturday at the Ruaraka grounds. The John Amboko-coached side’s good run was ended by Mathare in what team coordinator Samson Otieno sees as a wake-up call that will help them realize their season objective of finishing among the best five teams in the league. The Simba wa Nairobi currently occupies the fifth position on the FKF-PL log with 44 points from 30 matches albeit having played one more match than sixth-placed Kariobangi Sharks, but Otieno is positive they have the resources to finish among the top five. “We struggled to match Mathare’s momentum who were fighting to evade relegation but Rangers present a whole different proposition and I believe the boys are up to the task,” he told Citizen Digital. City Stars will miss the quartet of Flyer Rodgers ‘Okuse’, midfield general Peter “Pinchez” Opiyo, Roney Kola, and shot-stopper Wycliffe Otieno who have been ruled out for the season with injuries. However, Otieno sees their absence as an opportunity for younger players to gain experience and win the coach’s trust in the process. Also Read: “We have a large squad which cushions the coach from such eventualities. I don’t see their absence as a bother because the other members of the squad will step in and help us finish the season strongly.” As for Posta Rangers, they will be out to extend their impressive run to four matches without a loss after winning twice and drawing once in their last three outings. The mailers are ranked 12th on the log after accruing 35 points from 29 games and could move within two points of eleventh placed Bidco United should results go their way.
