Chief Justice Martha Koome has announced that 50 more magistrates will be recruited into the Judiciary from next month to help ease the case backlog. CJ Koome, speaking during a meeting with principal and presiding judges from the High Court in Nairobi on Monday, said the gap created in the High Court by the recent elevation of 10 judges to the Court of Appeal will also be addressed. “We also need a multi-door approach like the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution and Court Annexed Mediation to offload cases from the courts,” she said. She said more than 5,000 cases had been resolved through mediation with a success rate of 60 per cent, thereby injecting Ksh.14 billion back into the economy. “I will engage other stakeholders at the National Council on the Administration of Justice (NCAJ) to encourage use of plea bargaining,” she said, adding that all cases in the courts should be active before a clerk, deputy registrar or judge. CJ Koome, who as part of her strategy to clear the case backlog has been rooting for a no-adjournment policy, previously directed that all cases be resolved within three years of filing, and within a year in the appellate stage.

Over the same period, 2,315 new cases were filed, leading to a caseload of 6,038 as at June 30 this year,” Justice Achode said. “The division has also adopted use of the Judiciary Transcription System where court proceedings are recorded and transcribed real-time.” According to a statement to newsrooms, 1,556 cases were resolved in the Family Division out of 4,519; an additional 2,621 new cases were however filed.
