Harambee Stars goalkeeper Patrick Matasi has confirmed to Citizen Digital that he is on the verge of joining league leaders Tusker FC. Matasi who is a free agent after leaving St. Georges of Ethiopia said despite many clubs being interested in his services he has chosen Tusker FC because of the opportunity to play in the CAF Champions League  – a competition he is yet to participate in. “I will be travelling to Nairobi very soon to complete the talks that we have already started on phone, I want to see what they can offer to me and what I can give them. When everything is agreed then I will sign the contract and begin preparation for the new season,” said  Matasi. The Kenyan international also spoke of the importance of him having a pre-season with the club that he will be playing for, next season,  insisting it will help him gel with his team mates. “I have never participated in the CAF competitions and Tusker being the Kenyan representatives has been one of the major reasons I have considered the offer.  It will be a good opportunity for me to showcase my talent to the continent and help the team get to the farthest stage of the tournament,”Matasi told Citizen Digital. Tusker, Kenya’s representatives in the CAF Champions League next term are beefing up their squad and Matasi would be the third addition after Charles Momanyi who joined them from Gor Mahia and Kariobangi Sharks goalkeeper Brian Bwire.
