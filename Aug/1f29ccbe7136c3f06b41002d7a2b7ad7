Running through a Sisal Estate and Ranches, the Rally will provide a different challenge for competitors with varied terrain taking in smooth fast roads, rocky outcrops, the deep, red dust baths of Tsavo and the short blasts through parched bushland that may well prove very testing for heated tyres. Clerk of the Course Onkar Kalsi said the red soil route course is synonymous with the Safari Rally of old. “The route will traverse some of the most scenic routes under all sorts of conditions from flat out straights, twisty and technical sections,” said Onkar. Starting and finishing at the Voi Wildlife Lodge the route also visits the Izera Ranch, 23 km south of Voi off the main Mombasa highway where a 5.2 km spectator stage will be the center of attraction for all Rally fans, especially the enthusiastic fans from Mombasa. Voi Wildlife Lodge was the venue for scrutineering and administrative checks. A total of 22 cars were cleared to partake in the event which will count towards the fourth round of the KCB Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC).
