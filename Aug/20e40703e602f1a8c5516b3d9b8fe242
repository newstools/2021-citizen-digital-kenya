A 42-year-old man has succumbed to his injuries after his son hit him hard on the head using a blunt heavy metal rod. The two are said to have engaged in a heated argument on Monday night over a matter that is yet to be established. They then got into a physical altercation before the 17-year-old boy reportedly picked up the rod and landed it on his father’s head. “The man was rushed to Miteitei hospital while unconscious by his neighbours, but unfortunately, he succumbed yesterday while still undergoing treatment at the facility,” said the police. The juvenile has since been arrested by Nandi Hills detectives pending arraignment. Also Read: Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
