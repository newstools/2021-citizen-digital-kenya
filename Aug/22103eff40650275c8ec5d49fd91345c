Gor Mahia FC head coach Mark Harrison says they have to strengthen all the departments if they have to fight for the title next season. Speaking after their 1-0 win against Posta Rangers last evening Harrison said lack of options on the bench has been the major reason why they have struggled to get wins in recent matches. “We are struggling with depth at the moment; only 20 players are available for selection instead of 26 having lost two key players. We have to be very active in the transfer market. Hopefully we will be able to find a proper replacement for the departed players and good signings ahead of next season, “Said Harrison. Having lost star players Kenneth Muguna to Azam and Charles Mumanyi to Tusker fc the British tactician says he has only 20 players to select from during match days and meaning they have to be very active in the transfer window that begins on Monday. “We want to reclaim the title we have lost to our rivals next season and be competitive in the continental assignment that can only happen with a strong squad with enough depth to compete,” the British tactician stated.
