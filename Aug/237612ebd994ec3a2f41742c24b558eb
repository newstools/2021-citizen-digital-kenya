The Kenya Medical Association (KMA) has issued an advisory to Kenyans in response to an increase in COVID-19 infections linked to the delta variant. The association recommends that pregnant or breastfeeding women get the COVID-19 vaccines because the benefits outweigh the risks. The KMA said in a statement on Sunday that data shows that pregnant women are more likely to have severe Covid disease, including an increased risk of ICU admission and death, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy. “Still birth and preterm birth is more likely (compared to pregnant women without Covid 19) the statement from KMA explains “ Pregnant women with underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk of severe illness” The association also expressed concern about the rising number of infections in Kenyan schools, urging the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, to strictly enforce the implementation of Covid 19 management protocols in schools. “Rising infections have led to school closures, absenteeism and a general state of anxiety in the education sector,” the association added.
