Leeds United head coach Marcelo Bielsa says his contract situation has been “resolved” ahead of their Premier League opener away to Manchester United on Saturday. The 66-year-old would not give any details but indicated he had committed to a further season at Elland Road. He had been out of contract with the new season starting in a few days. “The contract situation is one that is already resolved,” Bielsa said through a translator. Bielsa joined Leeds in 2018, before leading the club to promotion back to the Premier League after a 16-year absence as a result of winning the 2019-20 EFL Championship. He praised the club’s hierarchy for their willingness to invest in training facilities and infrastructure, and indicated that played a role in his desire to commit to a fourth season.
