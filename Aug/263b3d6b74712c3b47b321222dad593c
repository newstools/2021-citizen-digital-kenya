Garissa, a Kenyan town less known for football has produced the winner of the annual East Africa Ligi Ndogo Cup after Berlin FC were crowned U19 champions. The tourney that was held in Kisamis, Kajiado County attracted only 46 teams from Kenya as Tanzania and Uganda were not able to register any teams due to the pandemic. The Safaricom sponsored tourney is aimed at nurturing talent. Men’s national team head coach Jacob “Ghost” Mulee who graced the finals as a guest of honour praised the organisers of the tournament for realising the importance of age group structures in development of football. “Right now the federation has set up age structures from U13 to U19, that is the triangle of development and if followed through it will be the start of getting top players who have gone through the ranks,” said the Harambee Stars head coach.
