Six police officers linked to the murder of two brothers, Benson Njiru and Emmanuel Mutura, in Kianjokoma, Embu County, will be detained for 14 days pending completion of investigations. The six; Corporal Benson Mbuthia, Corporal Consolata Kariuki, Constable Martin Wanyama, Constable Lilian Cherono, Constable Nicholus Sang, and Constable James Mwaniki, were presented before Milimani Law Courts Magistrate Daniel Ndugi on Tuesday morning. The court ruled that the 14-day detention period as had been requested by the prosecution lawyers was fair enough since it is a complex matter of great national interest. “14 days is not a long time…I agree with the lawyers that this is a matter of great interest…the family members want to know what killed the two Embu brothers, this can only be achieved if the police are given time to conclude investigations,” ruled the court. “It’s necessary to keep them in custody for their own safety…there’s tension on the ground and if released just days after their arrest, there might be anarchy.” Also Read: Video Of The Day: | CHASING HOPE | KEMRI undertaking stem cell research for treatment of Leishmaniasis
