Tusker FC head coach Robert Matano is under no pressure ahead of their Kenyan Premier League clash with Bandari FC set for Wednesday, despite allowing closest title challengers KCB to inch closer to them. The league leaders fell to a shocking 1-0 defeat to Nairobi City stars on Saturday, but Matano says his charges are known to perform better against the big teams – in the class of Bandari. “Losing matches is part of the game, it was unfortunate we dropped three crucial points over the weekend but we should keep our head high and be focused in the coming games. “Tomorrow is another day that we have to show our tradition of rising to the occasion against big teams and Bandari is one of them. Playing is a motivation already because we know how we perform against them,” said the veteran coach. Captain Eugene Asike has echoed Matano’s sentiments noting their main focus is to win the remaining five games, ignoring the pressure mounted by KCB who are just a point behind them. “It’s a very tight contest between the two team, this is where we need to give maximum concentration every minute we are on the pitch. The remaining five games are crucial to us if we have to win the league title. We will not look at what KCB is doing but stay determined to win the remaining matches,” stated the team Captain.
