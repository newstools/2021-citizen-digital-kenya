Kenyan international Pistone Mutamba has said he is looking forward to his next big challenge after cutting ties with FKF Premier League side Sofapaka. He was one of three players that left Sofapaka last week following the expiry of his contract with fellow forward Kepha Aswani also ending his stay at the club. Mutamba signed for Sofapaka in March after rejoining from Bidco United and left just four months later with the lanky striker is now eager to open a new chapter. “I am thankful for the time I had with the team and I wish them well in the future just waiting for a bigger challenge,” Mutamba told Citizen Digital. The 23-year-old was offered a season-long contract by Libyan top division side Asswehly SC in January but Bidco refused to process his release, forcing him to return to the country after just two weeks. That deal was off the table by the time he received his release, and Sofapaka snapped him up along with David Kin’gatua. Also Read: “Sofapaka FC announce we have parted ways with three players.
