Community rangers in Taita Taveta have asked the Ministry of Health to prioritise them in the ongoing vaccination against Covid-19, saying they are among the frontline workers. While addressing the media Tabitha Ndombolo, the assistant Warden in Kasigau said rangers vaccination is key in fighting the spread of coronavirus at the conservancies as they receive a lot of guests also in their daily duties. “A ranger is a teacher, researcher, security guard, a marketer and the foundation of wildlife conservation. We are asking the government to fast-track vaccination of our rangers as part of the fight against the pandemic,” she said. Ndombolo also acclaimed the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife for opening doors for the Covid-19 stimulus programme for community rangers’ salaries in 160 conservancies across the country since last year, requesting the government to prolong the package. “The Covid-19 pandemic has not yet eased off completely, we are therefore appealing to the government to continue with this programme after the proposed one year ends and possibly make it permanent,” added Ndombolo. 524 rangers are in charge of 33 conservancies and ranches which spread across 1 million acres in the vast Tsavo ecosystem.
