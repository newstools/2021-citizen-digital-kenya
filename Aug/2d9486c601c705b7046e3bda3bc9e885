The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) is seeking to seize assets worth nearly Ksh.1 billion linked to a manager of the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA). Benson Muteti Masila, an Engineer and KeRRA Coast Regional Manager is accused of amassing wealth to the tune of Ksh.952,363,824.99 through receiving kickbacks from contractors awarded tenders in Kilifi, Mombasa and Makueni Counties among other unexplained sources. According to the EACC, the properties including bank and M-Pesa deposits, apartments, motor vehicles and listed shares were acquired between February 2009 and December 2018. “Cumulatively the above unexplained wealth comprises bank and M-Pesa deposits amounting to Ksh.567,626,872.55, landed properties valued at Ksh.347,040,000.00 motor vehicles valued at Ksh.5,350,000.00, listed shares valued at Ksh.2,240,000.00 and insurance policies with a maturity value of Ksh.30,106,952.44,” says the anti-graft agency.
