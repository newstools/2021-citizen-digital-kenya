Kakamega Homeboyz head coach Nicholas Muyoti wants his charges more composed as they take on Bandari FC in their next Premier League match, after losing their midweek clash 0-1 to Gor Mahia. The former Harambee Stars captain was crestfallen after the loss, saying they had golden opportunities to cage Gor including two wasted penalties, but poor finishing denied them. Bandari, coming from a 2-1 win over Tusker FC in the midweek clash played at the Mbaraki Sports Club Mombasa, will be a hard nut to crack according to Muyoti. “You can’t predict how the match will be right now, Bandari will be facing us with a lot of confidence after the Tusker. It is important to rectify our mistakes and focus on getting three points in that match,” said Muyoti. He exactly knows what to work on, in his bid to finish the season on a high. “When we get to the final third we are in a hurry to score and we end up wasting the golden opportunities that we create in crucial matches. That we have to improve before we tackle Bandari,” stated Muyoti.
