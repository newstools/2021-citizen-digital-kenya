Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang’i has assured the family of two brothers who were found dead after being arrested by police that investigations into their deaths will be fast-tracked. The CS spoke on Wednesday when he met the family of Benson Njiru (22) and Emmanuel Mutura (19) alongside Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai and Attorney General Kihara Kariuki. CS Matiang’i further sought to assure the family that police officers found linked to the deaths will face full force of the law. “My colleagues AG Kihara Kariuki, @IG NPS, senior security officials and I, have reassured the family of the late brothers Benson Njiiru and Emmanuel Mutura of hastened investigations to the untimely death of their sons. As a parent, it pains me a great deal,” he said. “We will be patient for the final report and stop at nothing to ensure justice is served. Action will be swift and decisive on any officer found to be culpable. Once again, my condolences to the family.” The deaths of the two who were arrested for allegedly disobeying the curfew led to days of riots in Kianjokoma, Embu County.

The injuries were not consistent with those that would be expected from a person who jumped out of a moving car, according to the autopsy, which was conducted by three pathologists: Dr Martha Mwangi, representing the family, Dr Ndegwa, representing the Independent Medico-Legal Unit (IMLU), and Dr Doris Namu, representing Embu Hospital. They reportedly died as a result of broken ribs and head injuries caused by a blunt object; Benson’s body had multiple injuries, and the cause of death was not determined, while Emmanuel’s body had head injuries, which were ruled as the cause of death.
