National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi now insists that he should not be counted out of the 2022 State House race. Speaking in Nairobi on Thursday while meeting with the Nairobi City Traders Speaker Muturi said its time Kenya got a leadership change. According to Muturi, the current crop of leaders have been at the helm since time immemorial and cannot be tasked with eradicating corruption as most of them are corrupt. “Kenya inahitajika mabadiliko ya viongozi…tunahitaji Sura mpya kati uongozi sio wale wamekuwa serikalini kwa muda mrefu na kukosa kutokeleza mabadiliko..” Speaker Muturi said on Thursday. At the same time Muturi who was also recently coronated Mt Kenya region spokesperson said Kenya needs a policy change to address issues that affect small business owners. “Sera zahitaji kubadilishwa kuwashughukulikia wafanyi biashara wadogo…watu serikalini wamekosa kuajibika..inabidi rais kuangilia kati kila wakati ili kuwanasua wafanyibiashara wadogowadogo,” he added. Speaker Muturi also seized the opportunity to speak against police brutality, saying security people should treat Kenyans with dignity. “Let look into training ya maafisa wa polisi ili kuleta mabadiliko..visa vya watu kupotea na kuawawa zimeongezeka. ..polisi lazima waajibike,” Speaker Muturi said. He joins among others, Wipers Kalonzo Musyoka, ODM’s Raila Odinga and Deputy President Wiliam Ruto who are all gunning for the seat.
