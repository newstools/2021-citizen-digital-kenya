The prime suspect behind the murder of four men in Kitengela last week has been arrested. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) arrested the suspect, identified as Benson Melonyie ole Mungai, from his hideout in Kitengela town on Monday evening. The 40-year-old who is believed to be the mastermind of the killings is said to have gone into hiding in the area since the four were killed. “His arrest comes a few days after DCI took over investigations into the murders and moved with speed to pursue the killers,” reads a statement seen by Citizen Digital. “Ole Mungai was positively linked into the brutal killings after forensic investigations placed him at the scene of the crime where it was established that he led and coordinated the killing of the four.” A manhunt is presently underway for the rest of the killers.
