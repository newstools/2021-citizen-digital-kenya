Six police officers linked to the deaths of two Embu brothers,  Benson Njiru Ndwiga and Emmanuel Mutura – at Kianjokoma will face murder charges. This is according to a statement issued on Monday by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) following the conclusion of probe into the deaths. “This investigation was informed by Section 25 of the IPOA Act which demands that deaths that occur while in police custody, as a result of police action or are caused by members of the National Police Service while on duty, be investigated by the Authority,” the IPOA said. The Authority stated that investigations had established a prima facie case against six police officers for the crime of murder. The IPOA recommends that officers be relieved of their duties immediately pending the outcome of an independent review of the findings, which will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. “As it stands now, the six officers face a capital offence – murder.” The IPOA said “This recommendation is not likely to take a different direction” Also Read: The six officers have been ordered to surrender any government property they have in their possession, including their firearms, and to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for further assistance. “The officers and their commanders, who have since been interrogated and their statements recorded, be available round the clock for further assistance to IPOA investigators when called upon,” the Authority added. In addition to murder, the Authority is pursuing other charges, such as negligence in performance of duty, which may have been committed by any other officers who attended to the two brothers’ deaths.
