Sifan Hassan began her quest for an unprecedented Olympic treble by winning 5,000m gold on a rain-soaked Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, Japan on Monday night. World champion Hellen Obiri of Kenya took silver after leading for virtually the entire race until the final lap but was unable to cope with her Dutch rival’s sprinting in the final 300m. Hassan, a world champion in the 1,500m and 10,000m, ran a patient, strategic race and trailed the leading pack most of the way before pushing hard on the last lap for victory. Obiri had looked comfortable in the lead with four laps to go with Agnes Tirop and Ejgayehu Taye also vying for the lead just a stride behind the world champion. Taye then took a slight advantage heading in the next lap with Gudaf Tsegay edging Tirop for the third spot while Hassan reeled away from the rear group to join a leading pack of six. Obiri regained a clearer advantage heading to the final lap and led at the bell before Hassan gained on her with a spectacular burst of acceleration.
