The government has extended the registration of KCPE and KCSE national exams by 2 weeks. In a statement issued on Monday, Education CS Prof George Magoha said the exercise will be extended to August 14, 2021 to allow schools to ensure all candidates are registered. The exercise, which started on June 2nd, 2021, was scheduled to close on July 31st, this year. The Ministry has since revised the dates following a request by Head Teachers and Principals. This will be followed by verification of candidates’ registration details between August 16th and 27th, 2021. Those who fail to register for the 2021 examination due in March 2022 will only be allowed to sit the examination in December next year. “The Head Teachers and Principals are reminded to ensure that all bona fide candidates are registered for the examination within this final two weeks. Any candidate who fails to register for the 2021 examination to be sat in March 2022 will only be allowed to sit the examination in December 2022. Late registration shall not be allowed,” the CS said. On hosting of schools with less than 30 candidates, CS Magoha stated: “All primary and secondary schools (public and private), with less than thirty (30) candidates will be hosted in schools within their proximity and locality that have more than thirty (30) candidates.
