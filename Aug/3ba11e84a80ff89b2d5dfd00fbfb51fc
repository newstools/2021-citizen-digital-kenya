Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho has absolved his office from the drama surrounding the blocking of Deputy President William Ruto from a trip to Uganda. PS Kibicho stated that the deputy president must have presented inadequate documents to the immigration officers at the Wilson Airport for them to bar him from travelling. One of these documents, the PS intimated, is specifically a clearance document from the Head of the Public Service. “I’ll say this, before you travel, you need to have a Visa, a ticket, a COVID-19 free certificate, and if you’re a civil servant, you need to have a letter of clearance. If he actually had all those, I would be surprised that he was stopped,” he said. The DP, in a Wednesday morning interview on Inooro TV, defended himself stating that he did not need State clearance for a private visit to a friend. According to the Ruto, he has been making such personal visits to various countries since he became the DP nine years ago and has never needed such clearance. Also Read: To this, however, PS Kibicho responded saying if the DP has been travelling without the relevant documents then perhaps it was an error on the side of the immigration officials that have been clearing him “I don’t know whether he has been having them (documents) because I have not been checking…we’re not the ones who actually clear him…but if he passes through an immigration officer, they will demand that letter…if he ever travelled without them, the immigration officer failed, and you can’t accuse another one who has chosen not to fail, but those are facts I don’t have,” said Kibicho.
