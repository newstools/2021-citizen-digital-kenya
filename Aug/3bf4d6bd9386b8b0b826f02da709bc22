President Uhuru Kenyatta is said to be keen on a Raila candidature given Odinga’s popularity, charisma, influence and countrywide support base. That notwithstanding, the president, the opposition chief and his former allies find themselves in a precarious position—a day after the Mombasa State House meeting, the three One Kenya Alliance principles were standing their ground.
