An autopsy performed at the Embu Level 5 hospital ruled out the hypothesis that two Embu brothers who died in police died after jumping out of a police car. The injuries were not consistent with those that would be expected from a person who jumped out of a moving car, according to the autopsy, which was conducted by three pathologists: Dr Martha Mwangi, who represented the family, Dr Ndegwa, who represented the Independent Medico-Legal Unit (IMLU), and Dr Doris Namu, who represented Embu Hospital. Benson Njiru Ndwiga, 22, and Emmanuel Mutura Ndwiga, 19, died as a result of broken ribs and head injuries caused by a blunt object. Benson Njiru’s body had multiple injuries, and the cause of death was not determined. According to the autopsy, Emmanuel Mutura’s body had only head injuries, which were ruled as the cause of death. The siblings’ mysterious deaths have sparked clashes in Embu, where locals accuse gun-toting cops of murder.
