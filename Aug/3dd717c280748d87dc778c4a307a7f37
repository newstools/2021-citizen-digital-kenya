The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has provisionally suspended former 100m national record holder Mark Otieno as it commences disciplinary action against the Kenyan sprinter. Otieno is one of four athletes who were alleged to have violated anti-doping rules following tests conducted by the International Testing Agency (ITA) during the recently concluded Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. The 28-year-old was withdrawn from the Olympics team just hours to the men’s 100m heats where he was set to make his debut at the Summer Games. According to AIU, Otieno samples tested positive for the prohibited substance Methasterone, ranked among the Anabolic Androgenic Steroids (AAS). In another blow to the sprinter, AIU revealed they have been notified of another Adverse Analytical Finding on another sample collected from Otieno on June 24 by the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK). The case has since been handed over to AIU who said “The determination of consequences for the ADAK sample will also follow the conclusion of the ITA proceedings against Odhiambo.” Also Read: The athlete is thus suspended temporarily from participating in any competition or activity in Athletics prior to a final decision at a hearing conducted under the World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules or the Integrity Code of Conduct. Other athletes who are facing AIU disciplinary action are; 1500m athlete Sadik Mikhou of Bahrain, Benik Abramyan (shot put) of Georgia and Chijindu Ujah of Great Britain. Otieno maintained his innocence upon his suspension at the Tokyo Games. “My integrity as an athlete and an individual is paramount to me, and  I hold in great honor the opportunity I have been given to represent my country on this global stage, as I have done many times in the past. As such, I would never engage in any activity that would jeopardise me or my team mates.” He said in a worded statement.
