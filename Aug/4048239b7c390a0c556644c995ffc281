The national women’s rugby 15s team head coach Mitch Ocholla is upbeat his charges will hit top form during their build up matches in South Africa as they prepare to take on Colombia on August 25 in a Rugby World Cup repechage qualifier in Nairobi. Lionesses left the country Tuesday for South Africa where two warm-up matches against Women Boks are lined up at the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport, and Ocholla says the two test matches have come in handy as they eye to fine tune their skills for the Colombia clash. “Our biggest target is Colombia and everything is pretty good after four camps that we’ve had and which has brought the team closer in terms of cohesion and understanding. I’m optimistic that the team will progress to the World Cup,” said Ochola. The former men rugby sevens tactician added that the team, which had a weekly residential camps for the last one month which included two midweek training sessions at the RFUEA Grounds, has improved a lot. “The quality of team has greatly improved from July when we came to the setup and this is courtesy of having a partnership with parklands sports club and including a lot of competition from other clubs, thanks to the coaches and match officials who have worked with the team which is a big plus,” added Ochola. Lionesses will be boosted by the return of eight Olympians which according to Ochola is a massive boost to the side.
