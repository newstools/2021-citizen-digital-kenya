Lucy Wanjiru, a mother who has just lost her two sons, her only children is inconsolable. Her arrival in Kenya from the United Kingdom reminded her of the tragic death of her two sons Fredrick Muriithi and Victor Mwangi who were killed together with two others, Mike George and Nicholas Musa in unclear circumstances last Saturday. Wanjiru recounts the last moments when she spoke to her sons before they disappeared and later on found dead at City Mortuary. “Mara ya mwisho nilizungumza na mtoto wangu it was on Friday na akaniambia anataka kuenda birthday na nikamtumia pesa … Lakini Saturday niliwatafuta sikuwapata,” Wanjiru said. She decided to involve a neighbour, a friend and a clergy in searching for her children after she sensed danger as it was unusual for them to spend a day without talking to their mother. “On Tuesday nikaambia pastor sababu walikuwa waende kanisani na apostle Ben na akaniambia usijali mum kwa sababu waliniambia watakuja ndio nikapigiwa simu nikaambiwa watoto wangu wameuliwa,” Wanjiru says. Wanjiru condemned reports that her sons and their friends by irate villagers who thought they were out to steal their cattle “Ningetaka haki itendeke kwa sababu watoto wangu si wahalifu,” she added. Julius Muoki a friend to the four, is lucky to be alive as he was to join his friends for the birthday party but was held up at work. Members of the Private Bikers Association of Kenya earlier in the day held peaceful demonstrations in Kitengela protesting the deaths and demanding speedy investigations … Police are yet to arrest any suspect in connection with the deaths. Muriithi and Mwangi will be laid to rest at their rural home in Nyahururu, Laikipia County on Friday.
