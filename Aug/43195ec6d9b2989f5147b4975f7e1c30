Residents of Kiandieri village in Kirinyaga County are reeling in shock after one construction worker died and four others were injured when a water trench collapsed on them. The workers were digging the trench for a Ksh.1.2 billion water project which is being constructed by a Chinese company when suddenly they were buried alive. As they gasped for air, residents, police officers and county employees arrived and managed to rescue four of them. The survivors were taken to the Kerugoya County Referral Hospital for treatment. Kirinyaga Central Deputy County Commissioner Daniel Ndege said the contractor was to blame for the fatal  accident. “The contractor failed to ensure safety measures and he will be probed and face the law,” he said.
