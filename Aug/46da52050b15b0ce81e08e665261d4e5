Emmanuel Korir hopes of clinching a double at the Tokyo Olympics have been quashed after he was disqualified for a false start in the men’s 400m preliminaries held Sunday morning. Korir was lining up in heat four alongside a strong field that included the reigning champion Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa and World silver medallist Anthony Zambrano of Colombia. The race was stopped soon after the gun, and it was Korir who was on the focus, agonisingly leaving the track escorted by the officials having seen red. The Kenyan had already secured a spot in the 800m semi-finals to be held later on Sunday. It was the second time Korir was competing in both 400m and 800m in a major championship after he made it to the finals at the 2019 World Championships in Doha.
