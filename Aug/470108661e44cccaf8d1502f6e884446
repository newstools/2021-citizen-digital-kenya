Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja has challenged a move by the Nairobi Metropolitan Service and the City County Government to charge parking fees in residential areas. Speaking on Tuesday, Sakaja said Nairobians are already hard pressed with many struggling to meet their daily needs especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic effects which has deprived many of their income. “The people of Nairobi are not cash cows. Don’t charge Nairobians parking fees in estates. We have given you enough resources to do perform your work,” said Sakaja. “From Ksh.15 billion in 2017, we negotiated it up to Ksh. 19 billion this year in the Senate. On top of this, there’s what you’re already collecting. Our people are already hard pressed and over taxed. Wacheni tamaa.” The Senator added that he will be pushing a proposal to have the Nairobi Metropolitan Service summoned to the Senate in the next weeks to have the decision revoked. “We will summon NMS and Nairobi City County Government to the Senate in the next two weeks after recess to revoke this move,” he said.
