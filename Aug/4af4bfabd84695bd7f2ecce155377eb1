The Senator claimed only the DP has protested the Turk’s deportation while Turkey and its Embassy in Kenya have not complained about the handling of their national. “It has been established that this was a process of money laundering… how can you have business in Uganda instead of leaving Turkey and going to Uganda directly, you pass through Nairobi? They were trying to create a network fpor money laundering…” said Orengo. “We must summon Ruto before the parliamentary committee to speak on these matters and give us an answer if he is being truthful.” Speaking during the burial of David Ajwang Nyakwamba, father of Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’ at Waondo village in Suba North Constituency, Orengo told National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi to begin mobilizing MPs in the National Assembly so that Ruto can be summoned.
