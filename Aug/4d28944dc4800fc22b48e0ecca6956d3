Police officers in Nairobi are investigating an incident in which a senior police officer knocked down two pedestrians at the Carnivore junction on Thursday. Flora Mwongeli, a police officer based in Langata, was on patrol when she saw a vehicle speeding on the wrong side of the road with a dozen motorbikes hot in its wake, according to a police report seen by Citizen Digital. “She noticed something was amiss and sped off following behind and on reaching Langata barracks area, she found the motor vehicle already cornered and the driver being subjected to beating,” the police report explains.
