Felix kirui 28 years old herder, was rushed to Longisa county referral hospital having blood oozing from deep wounds inflicted by the leopard as he tries to protect his goats. According to Oreyet sub location assistant chief Samuel koech, the animal hopped into a nearby bush after wrestling the victim before police officers from Sigor police station arrived. “The animal was fierce and unhinged, after a police officer shot towards the direction where it was hiding, it pounced and tried to wrestle the officer who slipped and fell,” the chief said on Friday. The predator would then vanish into the thickets upon arrival of officers from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) who managed to trace and kill it.
