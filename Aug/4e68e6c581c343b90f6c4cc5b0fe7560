Koech, who trains in Silibwet in Bomet County, comfortably eased to victory without much fuss in the first heat clocking 8:52.43 to edge out Ethiopia’s Samuel Firewu who finished second in 8:52.87. Serem, who was in the second heat, outsprinted Tadese Tekele of Ethiopia in the final 100 metres clocking 8:29.98 to set up Sunday’s showdown against Koech. Speaking after the win Serem, who trains with the world record holder Eliud Kipchoge in Kaptagat, said he will be aiming to win gold for Kenya and put aside the recent Tokyo Olympics disappointments in the water and hurdles event. “All the Kenyans were not only disappointed but also surprised how we lost the 3000m title. The setback has instead motivated me and I want to show the world that Kenya’s dominance is still intact in this race. “I’ve run my heat tactically and I decided to stay behind my opponent so that I can study his tactics and for sure that has really helped because the moment I decided to move from behind him I knew I was ready to win it,” he told Citizen Digital. For the first time in more than 40 years, Kenya walked away from the men’s 3000m steeplechase without a gold medal in the Olympics after Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali ended that streak. Koech echoed his countryman’s sentiments but was quick to warn they will need to stay focused to win the race and avoid another setback in as many championships. “It’s no doubt the dominance is facing a big threat and we need to right the wrongs starting with this championship. It will be so demorilising if we falter again, so we must prepare well so that we can show the world that the steeplechase race is still a Kenyan event,” he added.
