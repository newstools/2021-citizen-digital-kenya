Nzoia Sugar FC head coach Ibrahim Shikanda insists the Millers must believe they can beat the drop and should roll up their sleeves as they enter their crucial final four FKF Premier League matches. They lost 1-0 against Sofapaka on Wednesday leaving them placed 14th on the log with 26 points, two places above the danger zone, and Shikanda says ‘they must show character in order to pick maximum points to survive’. “We could have easily won the match (against Sofapaka) in the first half because we created many chances that we failed to convert and that cost us the three points. “We need to be more clinical in front of the goals and take the chances that we have created to put the ball in the back of the net that and area we need to work on very hard in the remaining fixtures ,”said Shikanda. The Western based side face Wazito FC next Wednesday and then tackle Kariobangi Sharks before clashing with title contenders Tusker FC. They will wrap up the season against Gor Mahia. “We are remaining with very tough fixtures against some of the best team in the country some are defending champions other are chasing for the title. We’re in a situation where we cannot afford to drop any more points every game is like a final, that’s the only way we can survive the axe,”stated Shikanda Also Read: They sit 14th on the log with 26 points, five above Mathare United and Western Stima-who are placed 15th and 16th respectively, and six above bottom placed Vihiga United.
