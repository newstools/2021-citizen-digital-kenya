Talanta lost 3-0 to Vihiga Bullets with Kenyatta however blaming the loss on injuries within his playing unit, also saying they were unlucky. This was the biggest lost Talanta have suffered this season to the title chasing side, with an automatic ticket to the Premier League in mind. ‘’There is no team that cannot lose a match in the world, though the worst I could expect was a draw but we have lost, we will accept and plan for the next game,’’ he said. The results left Talanta topping the table with 62 points after 33 matches, nine points above second placed Kenya Police, with Kirinyaga based Fortune Sacco placed third after FKF docked them three points on Thursday. ‘’We are still on top so we are not under any pressure even though we are going away to face AP of Bomet whom you can’t underrate’’.
