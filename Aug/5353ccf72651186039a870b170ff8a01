Mwatate United head coach Andrew Rix Kanuli has rallied his troops to stage a strong performance against Shabana on Wednesday to keep alive their chances of finishing among the best four teams in the National Super League (NSL) this season. Mwatate’s turbulent season has seen them register one win, three draws and one loss from its last five matches and have 43 points, a haul that is enough for eighth place on the log. Kanuli wants his side to hold on to the slim chance of a top-four finish starting with tomorrow’s 3.00 pm clash against his former side at the Green Stadium Awendo. “We have had an underwhelming season so far compared to our objectives at the beginning. “I know Shabana are disappointed too with the kind of performances they have staged this season, but for tomorrow we will go there focused on collecting all points on offer.” Despite this being their first season in the second-tier league following a triumphant NSL/DIV 1 playoff against Mully Children’s Family (MCF) last season, the seasoned tactician is adamant that they could have challenged for automatic promotion to the premier league had there been interruptions to their season. Also Read: “The interruptions did not help our objectives as it robbed us of the necessary momentum to sustain a title bid.” He however feels their achievements this season will help them build a foundation for more success next season. “We will strengthen in the preseason for sure. Our aim at the moment is to build a good team that will challenge for the title next season. Against Shabana they’ll come up against a side that has endured a similar season as theirs, having made a bright start but let the foot off the gas as the season wore on to jeopardize their season ambitions.
