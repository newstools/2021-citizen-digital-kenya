Masinde Muliro University (MMUST) rugby head coach John Ochieng Ahaya says moving their home matches from Kakamega to Nandi has affected the team’s performances. MMUST moved their home matches after sports activities were banned by the government in the Lake Region due to Covid 19 situation, and Ahaya says the high altitude in Nandi is not working to their advantage. “We’re playing our home matches very far away from our home with different climate, high altitude areas but that’s what circumstances have afforded,” said Ahaya. Ahaya added that if they could be playing their home matches in Kakamega the results would be much better since they trainining venues and match venues are totally different. The western based side will face varsity side Strathmore Leos in match day nine with Ahaya confident of winning the duel. “Yes we expect to play Strathmore and we respect them, so we will be playing opponents that we respect and we know it won’t be easy but we hope and pray that it will go our way,” said Ahaya.
