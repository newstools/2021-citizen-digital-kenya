Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei has taken issue with the government over what he terms as poor treatment of Kenyan athletes who won the country medals at the Tokyo Olympics which came to an end on Sunday. Addressing a press conference today at Parliament buildings, Cherargei said that Team Kenya performed poorly at the Games and wants the technical team to take responsibility. Kenya bagged 10 medals- four gold, an equal number of silver and two bronze. According to the senator, this is one of the worst performances by Kenya. He also wondered why the team was not accorded a heroic welcome back home noting there was no high-ranking government official to welcome them upon return. Cheragei at the same time said that a better reward scheme should be in place questioning why Brand Kenya has partnered with some of the athletes as brand ambassadors yet the reward is negligible. Last year, Magical Kenya picked marathon great Eliud Kipchoge as its destination ambassador. Also Read: Kipchoge was among the athletes who bagged one of Kenya’s gold medals at the Games.
