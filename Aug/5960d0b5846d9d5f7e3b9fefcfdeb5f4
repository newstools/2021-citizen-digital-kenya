Deputy President William Ruto has condemned the arrest and subsequent deportation of Turkish businessman Harun Aydin, who has been described as one of his close associates. Ruto said he had spoken to Aydin who confirmed to him that he was asked to leave the country after being “politically arrested, tortured and falsely profiled as a ‘terrorist’.” The DP accused government operatives of engaging in “political pettiness” adding that this was dangerous for the economy. “Just talked and apologised on behalf of Government of Kenya to Aydin Harun, now in Turkey, who was politically arrested, tortured and falsely profiled as a ‘terrorist’ but later asked to fly out not to shame those involved. Political pettiness is expensive/dangerous & will destroy our economy. SHAME,” said Ruto in a tweet. Aydin, who was arrested at the airport and detained after landing into the country from Uganda on Saturday, was expected to be arraigned on Monday to face charges of “suspected terrorism financing.” Aydin was being held by anti-terror police and was set to be arraigned at the Kahawa Law Courts.
