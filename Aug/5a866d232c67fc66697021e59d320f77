Amason Kingi has been replaced as the Kilifi County chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement party. Teddy Mwambire, Ganze member of Parliament has taken over the Chairmanship. Kingi is accused of being disloyal and having aligned himself with a new political party. He has been spearheading formation of a Jumuia coastal political party as a way to increase the stakes for Coastal region in the 2022 politics. This has seen him clash with a section of ODM leaders from the region, who have been calling for his removal from the chairmanship position. Kingi’s replacement comes days after the Kilifi ODM youth league chairman Samir Nyundo resigned from the Orange party. The Kilifi Governor was conspicuously absent during ODM party leader Raila Odinga’s recent tour of Kilifi County.
