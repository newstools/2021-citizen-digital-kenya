Sylvia Chelangat ventured into new territories to deliver a bronze medal for Kenya in the women’s 400m at the penultimate day of the World Under-20 Championships. Chelangat came home third in the one-lap race in 52.23 after trailing Imaobong Uko of Nigeria who bagged gold in 51.55 as Kornelia Lesiewicz took silver in 51.97 with the trio notching personal best in the race. Chelangat brought curtains down on what was a successful day for Kenya with Heristone Wanyonyi (10,000m race walk) and Vincent Keter (1500m) having bagged gold medals earlier on Saturday. Ahead of the final day, Kenya tops the medal standings with nine medals; five gold, one silver and three bronze. Kenyans will be hoping to bag more medals on Sunday with finals lined up in the men’s 400m hurdles, 800m, 3000m steeplechase, and 4x400m relay as well as the women’s 1500m and 5000m.
