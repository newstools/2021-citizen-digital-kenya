Former Kwale Woman Representative Zainab Chidzuga has died at a Nairobi hospital of suspected COVID-19 complications. Chidzuga was reportedly hospitalised for two weeks over heart complications as a result of contracting the coronavirus. A source who spoke to Citizen Digital on condition of anonymity said the family is seeking to raise a Ksh.2 million hospital bill accrued when Chidzuga was in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Chidzuga served as the Maendeleo ya Wanawake Chairperson in the ‘90s before becoming the first Kwale Woman Representative in 2013; a seat she won on an ODM ticket. In 2017, she joined the Jubilee Party and lost the seat to current Kwale Woman Representative Zuleikha Hassan who flew the ODM party flag. She was then appointed to serve various State boards by President Uhuru Kenyatta, who during the last year’s Mashujaa Day Celebrations awarded her with a Head of State Commendation.
