Nicholas Muyoti has joined Football Kenya Federation Premier League side as head coach just a day after resigning from a similar role at Kakamega Homeboyz. He replaces Sanjin Alagic who left the Nairobi-based club in July citing the impact of Covid-19 on his family life. Muyoti who left Homeboyz on Monday will be tasked with steering the Hope Center-based side to more excellence following a seventh-place finish on their return to the topflight league last season. According to City Stars coordinator Samson Otieno, the former Oserian FC, Zetech University FC, Thika United and Nzoia Sugar FC coach will be deputized by club legend John Amboko who has been in charge on an interim basis following Alagic’s exit. “Nicholas Muyoti is the new Nairobi City Stars head coach. “He takes over from Sanjin Alagic who resigned July,” his statement read.

One of former Kenya international’s immediate tasks will be to sew up the outfit’s porous defense that allowed in a staggering 30 goals and being a former defender makes him the perfect fit for the job. His appointment will also come as a boost to the team that staged an indifferent finish to the season with the four wins in their last ten matches undermining their bright start to the season culminating in a seventh-place finish.
