A Nyeri court has issued a warrant of arrest against four police officers for failing to show up for inquest proceedings at the scene of an accident that killed Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru in 2017. In a ruling along the Thika super highway, Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo also summoned Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga, Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua, the Nyeri County Secretary and the Chief of Staff to shed light on issues raised in the public inquest into the death of the 3rd Nyeri County boss. According to the chief magistrate, the four officers were meant to be present as they had been served with summons to be at the scene of accident that claimed the life of Governor Gakuru on the 7th of November 2017 only months after he got into power. Governor Mutahi Kahiga who was then a deputy has been summoned to appear in court to shed light on sentiments he made after the accident on the mechanical condition of the vehicle the governor was in and what he has said regarding the anti corruption efforts of his boss. Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua was summoned in relation to audit queries at the county. “The issue of who allocated the vehicle to the driver did come up and that’s an area that needs to be clarified… there are also the other issues with the audit that have been raised that are critical, therefore am going to issue summons against the four who have been mentioned, starting with Paul Wambugu the chief of staff, Mr. Gachichio, County Secretary Nyeri County, Mr. Rigathi Gachagua, the MP Mathira and Governor Mutahi Kahiga Governor Nyeri County,” said Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo.
