The Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU) National Executive Committee has suspended the public universities lecturers’ strike that was set to begin on Monday. This, according to a statement issued by UASU National Secretary General Dr. Constantine Wasonga, is to give another stab at dialogue with the relevant bodies aimed at resolving the stalemate. The suspension followed a meeting by the UASU National Executive Committee meeting to review the status of implementation of the 2017-2021 CBA since issuing the strike notice on August 23, 2021. Dr. Wasonga said UASU also met “the Inter-Public Universities Councils Consultative Forum (IPUCCF) under  the auspices of the National Implementation Committee (NIC) over the implementation of the CBA.” He added that NIC agreed that “all public universities immediately submit returns to the NIC for purposes of audit and enforcement of  compliance with the 2017 – 2021 CBA.” “UASU National Executive Committee has consequently directed that the Union suspends its strike notice to give a final  chance for dialogue,” said the union Secretary General.

The Union thanks all academic staff for their readiness to fight for the dignity of dons.” Video Of The Day: | CHASING HOPE | KEMRI undertaking stem cell research for treatment of Leishmaniasis
