Emmanuel Wanyonyi continued Kenya’s dominance in the 800m when he obliterated the championships record en route to striking gold at the World Under-20 Championships. On a sunny afternoon at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, Wanyonyi and compatriot Noah Kibet took to the field as the clear favourites after dominating both in their heats and semi finals. With Kibet going for the lead from the gun, Wanyonyi was third just behind his compatriot and Algeria’s Mohammed Ali Gouaned. With just 200m to go, Kibet went out of gas as Gouaned threatened to spoil the Kenyan party but Wanyonyi sprinted in the final 100m to secure the title in 1:43.76 The Algerian would hold on to take silver as Kibet settled for bronze in a personal best of 1:44.88 Purity Chepkirui bagged Kenya’s seventh gold medal at the championships after reigning supreme in the women’s 1500m.
