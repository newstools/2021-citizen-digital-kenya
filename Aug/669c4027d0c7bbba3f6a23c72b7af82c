Kenyan basketball star Eric Mutoro says the Morans have to improve on their defense if they hope to achieve their target of progressing beyond the group stages of the upcoming Afrobasket Championships in Kigali, Rwanda. Morans narrowly edged Ulinzi Warriors 75-72 in a build-up friendly match on Monday leaving Mutoro feeling they allowed the opposition too much attacking joy and they must improve ahead of their trip. “Everything we practiced during training was well executed during that friendly against the best team in Kenya but looking at who we are going to face in the championship I feel we can use the remaining training sessions to improve our defence before the championship begins,” Mutoro said. The Morans under the leadership of coach Liz Mills will be holding their final practice session on Friday before departing later the same day and Mutoro said they are in high spirits ahead of the continental championship. “We are in high spirits having trained so hard since we joined the camp and despite the tough teams that we have been pooled against am sure we have the determination of going past the group stages of the tournament then see what happens after that,” stated Mutoro The Morans are expected to play another friendly match in Rwanda before the start of the tournament on Tuesday next week when they will begin their campaign against Ivory Coast.
