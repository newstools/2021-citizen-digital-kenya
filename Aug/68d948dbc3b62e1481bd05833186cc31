Four people were on Sunday afternoon arrested in possession of 100kg of elephant tusks worth over Ksh.10 million for illegal trade in Kangari town, Murang’a County. The four; Martin Mungai Nginya (58), Peter Macharia Njuguna (32), Edward Mwambura Kamau (55) and Samuel Njuguna Mwirigi (43) were found in possession of 19 pieces of the jumbo tusks. The suspects were ambushed in two separate motor vehicles ready to conduct the illegal trade by a multi-agency team christened ‘Interpol Usalama 7’ that has been pursuing the syndicate. The sleuths confiscated the cargo stashed in the boot of one of the cars in two sacks guised as loads of cabbages. “The suspects have since been placed in custody and undergoing investigative interviewing, with detectives seeking to effect more arrests on possible poachers and the targeted market for the products,” read a police statement.
