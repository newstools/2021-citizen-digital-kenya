Residents of Siranga trading centre in Ugenya sub-county woke up to a shocking incident on Monday morning when four night guards were found murdered by suspected thugs. The four night guards who have since been identified as Patrick Ondoo, Bernard Odhiambo Orindo, Ochieng Radido and George Agara, were murdered in cold blood and their bodies dumped behind the respective shops that they were guarding. According to Daniel Owino, one of the traders, he got a call in the morning that  his watchman had been killed and rushed to the scene only to find his body dumped behind the shop. The residents, who were angered by the incident, blamed the police for not doing enough to provide security in the area, arguing that Siranga Police Post is less than 100 meters from where the gruesome murders were executed. They complained that the rate of insecurity has tremendously increased not only at Siranga trading centre but in other areas in the sub-county including Yenga and Bar-Awendo trading centres, but that nothing was being done. Ukwala location Chief Michael Osodo confirmed the incident noting that two shops were broken into and property whose value is yet to be established stolen. Also Read: Mr. Osodo, who stated that investigations have been launched into the matter, equally wondered how the crimes happened without the police officers a stone-throw distance away being alerted. The bodies of the deceased are awaiting transfer to Ukwala sub-county hospital mortuary pending postmortem.
