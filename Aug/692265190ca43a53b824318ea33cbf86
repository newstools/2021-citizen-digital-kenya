Kenya is looking to advance ties with South Korea through increased trade particularly in coffee. Industrialization Cabinet Secretary Betty Maina says there has been interest for orders of up to 10 -11 tonnes of coffee from the Asian nation. “The feedback that we received from the expo we attended in Korea is that they have a huge affinity for Kenya’s coffee. There was an immediate interest for orders of over 11 tons of coffee that we are following up with,” she said. The ministry is also in talks with the Korean government to either reduce or remove the 8% tax imposed on Kenyan coffee. Maina says that this will increase the amount of coffee Kenya exports to Korea which currently stands at 12%. The CS says a visit to a recent expo also saw various Korean companies interest in investing in Kenya, especially in information technology and special economic zone sectors.
