St. Patrick Kamgundho Secondary School in Rongo, Migori County, has been closed indefinitely after students staged a protest over alleged poor management of the institution. Rongo sub-county Director of Education Dancan Odhiambo said they opted to close the school to ease the tension following the Wednesday night protests. The protests led to police officers being deployed to the school to bring back normalcy in the institution which has both boarding and day sections. Mr. Odhiambo said the school management alongside officials from the Ministry of Education will sit down to address some of the issues said to have caused the unrest. He expressed optimism that the matter will be solved in due course so that the learners can resume their schooling. The closure of the school affected the ongoing admission of Form One students as those who reported were forced to return home.
