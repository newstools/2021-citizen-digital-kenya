Kambaa Girls High School in Lari, Kiambu County, has been closed indefinitely following a fire that razed down a dormitory. The school’s Board of Management Chair Mukua Ngatia said they decided to close the institution as it could not continue accommodating the students following destruction of property. Ngatia stated that police have since embarked on investigating the cause of the fire, adding that parents will be informed on when to return their children to school as the dormitory also undergoes renovations. The Sunday inferno destroyed the first floor of a two-storey dormitory which accommodates 200 of the 700 students in the school. The Provincial Director of Education warned that the government will take legal action against any student who will be found to have been involved in the inferno. Parents were cleared by the school management and left the school compound with their children.
