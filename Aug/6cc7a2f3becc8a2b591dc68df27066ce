Switzerland playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri has completed a £9.5m move from Liverpool to Lyon. The 29-year-old has signed a three-year contract with the Ligue 1 club, who say the deal is worth 6m euros plus a possible 5m euros in add-ons. Shaqiri, who joined Liverpool from Stoke in a £13m deal in 2018, started just five Premier League games under Jurgen Klopp last season. He has not been involved in either of the club’s league games this season. The former Bayern Munich and Inter Milan attacker won the Premier League and Champions League during his time at Anfield. Shaqiri becomes the second Liverpool player to make a move to a Ligue 1 club this summer, with Georginio Wijnaldum having joined Paris St-Germain after his Reds contract expired.
