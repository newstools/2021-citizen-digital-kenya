The second edition of the Kip Keino Classic Continental Tour meet will be held on September 18 at the Kasarani Stadium. The event which is the only leg of the World Athletics Continental Tour Gold series being held in Africa has been moved from the Nyayo Stadium which hosted the inaugural event last year. While addressing journalists at Kasarani on Friday, race director Barnaba Korir said athletes from over 28 countries have already been confirmed for the one-day event. “At the moment we have confirmed athletes from some 28 countries but we are confident the number will rise to over 45 countries. We have our officials in Eugene and Brussels who are still bringing on board more athletes,” Korir said on the sidelines of the World Under-20 Championships. Korir said the event was moved to Kasarani Stadium owing to the facilities set up at the ongoing World Junior Championships. At the same time, Korir said the organisers are still in talks with the government to allow upto 20,000 fans to Kasarani Stadium for the event.

We have the blessings from World Athletics who have assessed the stadium and therefore we are still in talks with the government to see if they can allow just a third of the Kasarani Stadium,” said Korir. Korir was flanked by World Athletics CEO Jon Ridgeon who hailed Kenya for a successful inaugural event last year. “This event also seeks to promote local talents and let athletics fans enjoy the action. We will also seek to have many meetings not only in the gold meetings but also the silver and bronze meetings,” said Ridgeon. Also present were Kenyan athletes Mary Moraa and Kumari Taki who are set to compete in this year’s event. The Kip Keino Classic meet is the 12th and final leg of this year’s Continental Tour Gold series. Video Of The Day: | CHASING HOPE | KEMRI undertaking stem cell research for treatment of Leishmaniasis
