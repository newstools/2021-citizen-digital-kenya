Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has welcomed the decision by the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) to remove him as the party’s Chairman in Kilifi County. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Kingi thanked ODM leader Raila Odinga for giving him the opportunity to serve in the position for the last nine years. “As I welcome the decision of the ODM party to replace me as the Kilifi County ODM Party Chairman, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Party and more particularly, the party leader the Rt Hon. Raila Odinga, for giving me the opportunity to serve as the Kilifi County ODM Chairman for the past nine years,” said Kingi. Kingi said during his tenure as Kilifi County ODM chairman the Orange party had become the dorminant party in the county, setting a record in the last elections. “…I steered the party to great success and made sure that ODM became the dorminant Party in the County, a fact that was confirmed during the last general election when Kilifi became the only County in the Country to deliver a clean sweep for the ODM Party in all elective positions,” he said. He added: “I hope and pray that the incoming Chair and his team will match and/or break this sterling record. I wish the Party the very best not just in Kilifi County, but across the country as it prepares itself for the 2022 elections.” Also Read: Kingi’s position as Kilifi County ODM Chairman will be taken over by Ganze Member of Parliament Teddy Mwambire.
