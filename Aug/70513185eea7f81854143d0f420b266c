President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to the family, friends and relatives of former Kamukunji MP George Gregory Wilson Nthenge. Nthenge, a maverick independence-era politician, former Cabinet Minister and businessman, passed away on Tuesday night aged 94 years. In his message of comfort, the President eulogised the former legislator as an elder statesman, and an icon of Kenya’s independence struggle who played a pivotal role in entrenching democracy in the country. “It is disheartening to learn of the passing away of George Nthenge, one of our country’s few remaining independence-era politicians, freedom fighter, and architect of our second liberation. “Mzee Nthenge was a highly respected elder statesman, pro-democracy agitator and mentor whose journey through life epitomized the rich political history of the Kenyan nation. “It is because of the solid foundation laid by George Nthenge and his generation of leaders, and their work over the decades, that Kenya stands tall in the community of nations as a strong, democratic and prosperous nation,” the President eulogised.
