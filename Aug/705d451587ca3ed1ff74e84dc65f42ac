Police in Igembe Central have launched a manhunt for a Kangeta Prison warder who is reported to have fled with a gun, reportedly with the intention of killing his wife. According to a police report obtained by Citizen Digital, the officer, identified as Edwin Omuse, was spotted with a G3 rifle concealed in a sack at the Kangeta shopping centre around 7 p.m. on Wednesday. The matter was reported by senior sergeant Benjamin Ndunda. Just hours earlier, the officer had been issued a G3 rifle loaded with 20 rounds of ammo. Police officers familiar with the situation said he was overheard saying he was headed to Thika to kill his wife, who allegedly scammed him of Ksh.900,000. He had reportedly obtained the money as a loan from a local bank. Police officers accompanied by prison warders have been deployed to hunt down the officer.
