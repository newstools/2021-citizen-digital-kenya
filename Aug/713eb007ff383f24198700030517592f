Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho has told off those taking credit for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s development projects across the country. Kibicho without mentioning names accused some individuals of perpetually claiming to be responsible for delivering to the Mwananchi projects like infrastructure and electricity in rural parts. The Interior PS also assured that the government will scale up the fight against illicit brews to avert tragedies such as the one witnessed in Nakuru. “Yule mtu hafanyii uhuru kazi ni adui yangu… sisi tukuwe watu ambao wanaangaliana uso kwa uso na kusema tumeleta barabara… kama hatuendi barabara moja hakuna haja ya kukaa na nyinyi tukiongea…,” said Kibicho.
