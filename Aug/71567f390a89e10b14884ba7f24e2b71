The Nairobi County government has introduced a raft of new rules and regulations aimed at keeping the city clean and hygienic. The new regulations are contained in the Nairobi City County Public Nuisance Bill, 2021 that has been signed into law by Acting Nairobi Governor Ann Kananu. Among the regulations include a ban on blowing one’s nose without a handkerchief or tissue paper in the city, urinating in undesignated spaces, spitting on the streets, as well as sleeping in kitchens or food stores. The new law prohibits discharge of dirty water, sewer or effluent into streets or water channels, discharge of oils into roads or water channels, and obstruction of roads or streets. It also prohibits residents from allowing trees and hedges in their homes or places of work to obstruct streets or footpaths, further criminalising riding motorcycles or driving on footpaths, playing loud music, and smoking in undesignated places. Acting Governor Kananu urged Nairobi residents to familiarize themselves with the new law to avoid being caught offside, saying: “Nairobi is the face of Kenya. We all need a clean and hygienic environment to live and work in.” Also Read: “This is part of what we promised our great people of Nairobi. We must work round the clock to achieve this. A healthy environment is paramount to all of us.” County executive member for Environment, Energy, Water and Sanitation Larry Wambua thanked Riruta MCA Kariuki Kiriba for coming up with the bill at the assembly and ensuring that all stages were well articulated and now signed into law.
