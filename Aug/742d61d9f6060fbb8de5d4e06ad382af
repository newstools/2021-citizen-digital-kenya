Police in Gem, Siaya County, are investigating the death of a 37-year-old primary school teacher whose body was found in a bush where he is suspected to have been murdered. The body of the teacher, who has been identified as Joseph Oluoch Owino, was discovered by neighbors after he allegedly went on a drinking spree with some of friends but never returned to his house on Sunday evening. Ramula sub-location Assistant Chief Samuel Hezron Nyawalo said he received information from the area village elder about the body of the deceased, who was a teacher at Kanyoto Primary School. The administrator said he suspects the deceased was senselessly beaten because his body had bruises all over. He said the body has since been transferred to the Yala sub-county hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem as investigations continue. Mr. Nyawalo further stated that one person, identified as Elisha Odhiambo, has been arrested following the incident and is helping with investigations.
