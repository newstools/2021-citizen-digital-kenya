Makueni County Governor Kivutha Kibwana has defected from the Kalonzo Musyoka-led Wiper Party and rejoined Muungano party. Governor Kibwana now says he will seek the country’s presidency on the Muungano party ticket, adding that he will soon officially launch his presidential bid in Nairobi. The county boss defected from Muungano to join Wiper party in 2017, on whose ticket he secured his second term as governor. His stay at Wiper, where he also served as Chairman, has however not been all rosy as he has often clashed with party leader Kalonzo Musyoka. In February 2019, Kibwana told Radio Citizen that the people of Makueni whom he represents granted him permission to leave the Wiper party if he so desired. This came after the Makueni County boss had previously hinted at ditching the political outfit citing ideological differences with Kalonzo. Also Read: “There have been issues within the party, especially between myself and the party leader. I sat down with the people of Makueni and told them I could no longer be the (Wiper) party Chair and they said it was fine as it is not mandatory for me to hold that position in order to serve them,” said the governor in February 19, 2019. In July this year, Wiper wrote to Kibwana seeking a reason as to why he should not be expelled from the party for underminining Kalonzo. A day later, the governor dared the party to eject him saying: Let them (Wiper) do as they wish. I cannot stop them from ejecting me from the party… If I’m no longer useful to the party, I cannot stop them from doing what they want.” Video Of The Day: | CHASING HOPE | KEMRI undertaking stem cell research for treatment of Leishmaniasis
