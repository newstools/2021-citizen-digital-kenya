Kakamega Homeboyz head coach Nicholas Muyoti has left the club with his assistant Bernard Mwalala promoted to take over from him, team manager Boniface Imbenzi has confirmed. Muyoti, a former AFC Leopards and Nzoia Sugar tactician has already notified his employers and is likely to join one of his suitors from Tanzania or locally. “The previous head coach is also venturing into greener pastures and although he is yet to announce formally but I know it is underway. He has notified us in time that he has several offers for greener pastures and so we are already prepared because he has discussed with the office,” Imbenzi said. “Therefore Bernard Mwalala has taken charge as our head coach and so we are looking forward to having him take us into the new season,” Imbenzi said in an interview with Citizen Digital. Imbenzi has at the same time hailed Muyoti for a ‘great job’ done in his two seasons at the Kakamega-based side,  noting that the promotion of young talents from schools as one of his highlight achievements of the soft-spoken coach, adding that the club’s philosophy will be maintained by the new coach Mwalala who has been serving as Muyoti’s assistant. “As a club we have that philosophy of acquiring players from schools and not the ready material who have been sharpened by other teams and Muyoti has done that job very well,” said Imbenzi.
