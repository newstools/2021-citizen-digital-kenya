The government through the Business Registration Service (BRS) is undertaking a clean up of the business registry. The cleanup process involves unverified registered businesses covered as all businesses registered before December 2016. The proprietors of the businesses will be allowed to amend their registration number, company name, share structure details, directors & shareholders and residential addresses. The clean up process dubbed Link-a-Business is a two step process allowing business owners to verify and validate information provided to the business registry. The clean up exercise is aligned to the government’s goal of further loosening terms to doing business in the country.
