Mathare United are targeting a win against Ulinzi Stars at home as they fight to evade relegation following a defeat at the hands of Bandari over the weekend, head coach Frank Ouna has said. After winning three matches in a row, the slum boys lost 3-0 to Bandari in Mombasa and rekindled their relegation fear with two matches to the end of the season. Ouna has at the same time said conceding ‘easy goals’ against Bandari was the turning point in the defeat, noting that the Ulinzi game is a  do-or-die game for his side. “We must fight to the end and winning against Ulinzi Stars will be enough for our survival in the top tier,” said Ouna. “Very easy goals, we just gave Bandari(the game), especially the first two which demoralized us and we dropped all points,” lamented the former Wazito tactician. Mathare are 15th on the log, one and two points ahead of Vihiga United and Western Stima respectively(who are all in the drop zone), with just two matches left to the end of the campaign.

On his part Bandari’s counterpart Andre Casa Mbungo is insisting that the best present they can give to their fans is by finishing third. Bandari who are third will be visiting cash-strapped Sofapaka in Wundayi in Taita Taveta county before winding their season against Wazito, matches which the Rwandese is targeting maximum points as they target a strong finish. “We must win both remaining matches for us to finish third because that is the best position we can attain this season.” The 2020-21 season will conclude in the coming weekend before the other season commences in a month’s time.
