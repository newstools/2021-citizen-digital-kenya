Police officers in Nairobi’s Kilimani area responding to a distress call on Sunday night shot and killed two armed suspected carjackers. The gangsters, armed with a Russian-made pistol and two handguns, reportedly accosted a taxi driver and his client on Chania Avenue before robbing them of their mobile phones and taking over their vehicle. The police officers intercepted the thugs as they attempted to escape and ordered them to surrender. They however refused to heed to the order and instead opened fire at the officers while fleeing on foot. The officers also responded with fire, fatally injuring the duo, during the 10pm incident. Four mobile phones, including two stolen from the victims, were recovered alongside the three guns with six unspent rounds.
