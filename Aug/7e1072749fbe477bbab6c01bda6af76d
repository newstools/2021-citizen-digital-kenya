Kenyan based jobs listing platform Kazi has joined the global startup accelerator-the Catalyst Fund as part of its ninth cohort of fintech companies. The local startup is among five other companies picked for building solutions designed to improve the resilience of undeserved customers and communities. Kazi connects skilled and casual informal workers with jobs on demand while providing them with access to business advisory and financial services including digital payments and tools leasing. The platform works through a mobile-based application which on the flip-side allows clients to list available jobs completing the link to job seekers. Other companies to join the global tech accelerator include South Africa’s HealthDart, Nigeria’s Crop2Cash, Mexico’s Verqor and India’s Ohm Mobility and PocketFin. The six join 45 other companies and will receive catalytic capital, direct connections with investors and corporate innovators and expert support.
