Sprints coach Andrew Maritim is confident Kenya will shine in sprints at the World Under-20 Championships set to kick off on Wednesday at Kasarani Stadium. Kenya has fielded athletes in all the sprints events including; 100m, 200m, 400m and 400m hurdles for both men and women as well 100m hurdles women and 110m hurdles for men. Maritim said the junior athletes are ready to make forays in the sprints at the World Junior event. “We have been training for the past one month and I am very happy with our progress. My athletes are relaxed and we are just waiting for the competition. Our target is for them to first make it to the finals and then fight for a podium finish,” said Maritim. The experienced tactician is however wary of the tough competition that awaits Kenyans from Sprints powerhouses including Jamaica who have already arrived in the country. “We know countries such as Jamaica, Japan and others are very strong in sprints but we are ready to face them. What we have done we believe we can match their strengths and even beat them,” said a bullish Maritim. Also Read: At the same time, Maritim has also pointed out the impact made by the 100m national record holder Ferdinand Omanyala in the team. Maritim said the in-form sprinter has inspired the budding athletes having been the first Kenyan to run 100m race in under-10 seconds when he clocked 9.86 seconds to smash his record of 10.00 seconds in Austria. The 25-year-old therefore smashed his national record of 10.00 seconds he set at the Tokyo Olympics where he made it to the semi finals. “We really thank Omanyala for showing our youths that they can make it in sprints. Remember we have not been doing very well in short races but having him compete at the Olympics is the turning point in our sport,” added Maritim.
