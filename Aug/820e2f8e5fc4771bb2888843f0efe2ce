Defending Premier League giants Gor Mahia today held to a one-all draw by Thika side Bidco United in a Premer League match played at Ruaraka grounds. The match which was full of missed chances from both sides saw a number of players from both sides yellow-carded in the first half for unsporting behaviour. It was not until the 42nd minute when Burkina Faso import Abdoul Karim cruised through Bidco defence with a low shot to give Gor the lead. Samwel Onyango missed a late first-half chance when his shot went wide after creating a deserved scoring opportunity. The match went to the breather 1-0 in favour of K’Ogalo. Four minutes into the second half, rejuvenated Bidco United came in strong with a low shot by Anthony Simasi that found Mathew Gad off guard to make it 1-1. Gor Mahia introduced Alpha Onyango for Jules Ulimwengu who was completely marked. The second half was action-packed with both teams displaying standard football.
