Tokyo 2020 pole vault champion Armand Duplantis said he does not know his limits and wants to break his own world record several times over in the near future. It is only a matter of weeks since Duplantis took gold in Tokyo at the age of just 21, soaring over 6.02 metres at his first attempt. But the ambitious American-born Swede is not resting on his laurels, and is targeting his own outdoor world record of 6.15m and beyond. “I want to do everything you can in this sport. I want to win everything there is to win, and do it more times than anyone else has done it,” he told Reuters in an interview. “I want to get into the 6.20s. It has such a good ring to it. I don’t know what my limit is. If I feel like I am becoming stagnant then I will try something new. I am always going to be trying to get to a new level. There is more in the tank and I can hit a couple of new heights soon.” From a very sporting family, and influenced by his father Greg, who was a former U.S. pole vaulter, Duplantis grabbed the limelight when he twice bettered the indoor world record of 6.16m with clearances of 6.17m and 6.18m in February last year on the World Indoor Tour.
