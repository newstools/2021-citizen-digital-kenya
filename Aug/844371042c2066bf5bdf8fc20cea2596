Security has been beefed up at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani and its environs ahead of the World Under-20 Championships set to start on Wednesday this week. Inspector General of Police, Hillary Mutyambai said security is paramount and a large number of officers have been deployed in the stadium and the surroundings to ensure law and order. “We have deployed a good number of officers from all sectors because we are hosting a world event and we want an incident-free event. That is why we have mobilized a whole team to make sure all is well,” said Mutyambai. Without revealing the numbers of his personnel in what he said was a security matter, Mutyambai said the number of officers at the stadium was similar to the ones who provided the same services during the World Under-18 Championships in 2017. Mutyambai was speaking after meeting police commanders at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. “We don’t have the exact number of officers but it is similar to those deployed during the World Under-18 Championships in 2017. For every five people, you will see, four will be police officers,” he added.
