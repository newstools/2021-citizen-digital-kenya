Tanzanian heavyweights Young Africans SC have parted ways with Harambee Stars goalkeeper Farouk Shikhalo following the expiry of his contract. The shot-stopper who has been at Yanga since 2019 was released together with fellow keeper Metacha Mnata who featured for Tanzania in the CECAFA U-23 Championship a fortnight ago in Ethiopia. Shikhalo, a former Bandari FC player confirmed the development through his social media page, thanking the management and fans for his two-year stay at the Tanzanian club. His release came in the wake of arrival of Malian goalkeeper Djigui Diarra as well as former Gor Mahia midfield anchorman Khalid Aucho. “Yanga SC management would like to immensely thank our players Metacha Mnata and Farouk Shikhalo for their services,” read a statement from the club. “Metacha and Shikhalo have each served their two-year contracts. Yanga thanks the two stars for their services and wishes them the best in their football life outside Yanga.” Also Read: Shikalo commenced his career at National Super League league leaders FC Talanta, then known as National Youth Talent Academy before moving to Tusker FC. He then ditched the 11-time Kenyan champions for Muhoroni Youth before signing for Posta Rangers, and lastly landed at the Coastal based side Bandari FC where he was twice awarded as best goalkeeper in the local league before Yanga came calling for his signature. Yanga who will be making a comeback in the CAF Champions League are beefing up their squad to match the competition in the top continental tourney. They have also captured the signatures of strikers Heritier Makambo, Fiston Mayele and Yusuph Athuman. The ‘Timu ya Wananchi’ will pitch camp in Morocco as part of their pre-season alongside their rivals Simba SC who will also be in the northern Africa country.
