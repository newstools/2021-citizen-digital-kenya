Police in Nakuru County are holding a man after he allegedly found another man in his house and killed him. Micah Nyaberi Bogomba, 39, reportedly returned to his house in Nakuru’s Kagoto area unannounced and found 34-year-old Boniface Njagi Maina with his wife, Harriet Vivian Mboga. Nyaberi, according to a police report seen by Citizen Digital, demanded to know what Njagi was doing with his wife, before descending on him with blows and kicks. “Subdued and seeking to escape with his life, Njagi is reported to have pleaded with Nyaberi to let him have his shoes and leave, but the pleas were met with a stab on his back slightly below the scapula,” read the police report. The chaos woke up neighbours, who alerted police officers from Kagoto Patrol  Base. “In the suspect’s house, police also found spattered blood on the walls and house items, which has since been documented by crime scene detectives,” added the report.
