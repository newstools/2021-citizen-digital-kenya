AFC Leopards hope to finish third on the FKF Premier League standings when the season concludes over the weekend when they will face Kakamega Homeboyz at the Thika Municipal Stadium. Leopards are fourth with 48 points, two behind Bandari FC who play Wazito FC in their final clash of the campaign. “The only challenge is we are losing a player every game and as you see today we have lost defender Washintone Munene who is injured and he has been very outstanding to our defense. “But we are going to re-organize and try to win that game even without our many injured players,” assistant coach Tom Juma said. The 12-time champions managed only a point against title hopefuls KCB thanks to a 1-1 score, a match that Juma hailed his boys for giving their all. “For sure we expected to win this match, we want to finish third and finish the season on a high. The boys have played well and given it their all despite failing to be clinical in front of goal, so the draw is not that bad bearing in mind that better a point than losing everything,” Juma added. Also Read: Leopards came into the match without their head coach Patrick Aussems who flew back home in Belgium for a short break to see his family before he returned to sharpen the boys for the new 2021-2022 season which begins on September 25. Ingwe are in position four on 48 points, only two behind third placed Bandari FC who came from behind to force a two-all draw against Sofapaka in Wundanyi.
