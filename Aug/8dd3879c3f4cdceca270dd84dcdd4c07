A police officer accused of raping a refugee was denied bail by a Lodwar court on Friday. Police constable Kennedy Kamande is reported to have fled after raping a 40-year-old refugee at Kakuma 4 patrol base in Turkana County in 2019. Appearing before Lodwar Chief Magistrate Mwangi K Mwangi, Kamande denied charges maintaining his innocence. The accused person was denied bail for being a flight risk. After being released on police bond in 2019, Kamande disappeared from police radar, only for him to be arrested by the National Police Service’s Internal Affairs Unit that had been tracking him down since then. With the prosecution lining up 13 witnesses, the case is expected to commence on the 2nd of September.
