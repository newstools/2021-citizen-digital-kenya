Kenya’s Erick Kiptoo Sang says he will have to work on his finishing if he has to compete well and win titles in future races. Speaking after finishing sixth in the men’s 1500m T11 at the Tokyo Paralympics, Sang said lack of endurance during the race cost him place in the podium. “I tried my best but the body could not just take it, my finishing was very poor and it’s an area I am going to work hard and improve in the coming races, I have learnt the lessons and the most important thing is the experience I have gotten and the need to work hard towards improving,” said Sang. Kiptoo was guided by Erick Kirui after his usual guide David Korir got injured on Monday after he was tripped. “Change of guide affected my performance because I was now forced to change tactics to adjust to his way of running; it was not easy but I tried my best under the tough conditions,” added. Despite the poor performance in Tokyo, Sang said he is not planning to rest after the games as he wants to continue working hard in preparation for the future competitions.
