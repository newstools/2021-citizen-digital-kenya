A 44-year-old teacher from Kanyadhiang’ village, Karachuonyo constituency in Homa Bay County has announced his presidential bid, seeking to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta whose two-term tenure expires in 2022. Felix Jarongo Odeny expressed interest in the presidential seat,  saying he will vie as an independent candidate in the next year’s poll. Speaking in Homa Bay Town, Odeny says that for many years he has developed interest in the country’s top job. His selling point? He has no affiliations to any political party. Odeny says that he resigned from his teaching job in 2018 at St Augustine University of Tanzania in the neighbouring country Tanzania. His sights are now on the quest to become Kenya’s fifth president. He says that even though he has not reached the level where Kenyans expect presidential campaigns, that will not deter him from making his dreams true. He exuded confidence that he will battle it out with other presidential candidates to ensure he wins in the next year’s polls Others in the race include Deputy President William Ruto, Mukhisa Kituyi and former paramilitary officer and Kiambu Bishop Zablon Karanja Mbugua Video Of The Day: | CHASING HOPE | KEMRI undertaking stem cell research for treatment of Leishmaniasis
