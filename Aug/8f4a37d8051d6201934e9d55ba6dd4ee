AFC Leopards defender Isaac Kipyegon is the first winner of the Fans’ Player of the Month Award, for the month of July. Just a few months after coming into his new role as club captain, Kipyegon got the award after guiding the club through a tumultuous July where Ingwe only beat Bandari, drew with Nzoia Sugar and lost to both Tusker and Western Stima. Leopards also suffered a blow when they lost in the FKF Cup final against arch-rivals K’Ogalo in the month. Kipyegon has thanked the fans for voting for him and dedicated the award to his teammates. “Without my teammates, this would not have come true. They are my biggest motivation but I am also grateful to the fans for making it possible,” said Kipyegon. On his part, Coach Patrick Aussems who recently extended his contract with Ingwe, thanked Leopards’ shirt sponsors for the initiative, saying it is a morale booster for his players.
