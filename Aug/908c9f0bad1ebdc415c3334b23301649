President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday received Somalia Prime Minister Hussein Mohamed Roble at State House, Mombasa where they are set to hold bilateral talks. State House said the two leaders will discuss subjects of mutual interest to Kenya and Somalia. This comes after a Kenyan delegation led by Foreign Affairs Minister Raychelle Omamo held talks with the Somalia Prime Minister in Mogadishu on Sunday. According to a press statement from the prime minister’s office, the neighboring states, whose ties have not been on a strong footing for several months, agreed to cement their relations particularly in the areas of diplomacy, trade and security. The statement further added that Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta extended an invitation for Somalia’s prime minister to visit Nairobi. Somalia has underscored that an existing maritime dispute between both nations will be decided by The Hague-based International Court of Justice, or ICJ, despite several requests by Kenya to reach a settlement out of court.
