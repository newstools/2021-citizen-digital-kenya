Vincent Keter notched Kenya’s fifth gold medal at the World Under-20 Championships after he reigned supreme in the men’s 1500m finals. Keter crossed the finish line in 3:37.24 to bag gold ahead of Ethiopia’s duo of Wegene Addisu (3:37.86) and Melkeneh Azize (3:40.22) who clinched silver and bronze respectively. His win ensured Kenya retained gold in the event last won by compatriot and training mate George Manangoi at the 2018 championships in Tampere, Finland. Another Kenyan Kamar Etiang who has finished third was disqualified after he stepped out of the line. Keter’s gold takes Kenya’s medals tally at the championships to eighth; five gold, a silver and two bronze.
