Nairobi City Stars head coach John Amboko has warned his charges against resting on their laurels as they take on troubled AFC Leopards on Tuesday in a Kenyan Premier League (FKF-PL) clash. City Stars stunned leaders Tusker on Friday in what was Amboko’s first win since taking over from Sanjin Alagic last month, but is not flattered by the recent big win. Ingwe have not won in the last three matches and missed Saturday’s match against Gor Mahia as they boycotted the league derby. “We won’t take be deceived by the troubles surrounding the team because they could be their motivation too. They have players who can a hurt any team on a good day, its true they have struggled in the recent games but they are still a very good side,” said Amboko. For the youthful coach, this season’s target has already been met, but still wants more as they seek to finish in a “respectable and motivating position.” “We already achieved our target this season and that was to remain in the premier league, I feel we can do more and surpass our target and by doing so we can improve and continue with the project to fight for trophies next season,” stated the tactician.
