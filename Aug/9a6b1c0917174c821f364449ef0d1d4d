The women’s 1,500m duo Purity Chepkirui and Winny Jemutai Boinett believe they have what it takes to earn a podium place during the World Athletics Under 20 championship slated for August 17-22. The 18-year-old Chepkirui, who hails from Nakuru County is happy to book a ticket to represent Kenya again after last year’s Africa Cross Country Championships  set for Togo were cancelled. “My training is going well, finally I will have a chance to represent my country. I was worried about the Covid-19 pandemic but this is a good opportunity to grow my talent. “Athletics is an event I decided to try out in 2018… I see the seniors win on television. When Kenyans win, it gives me the motivation to continue with my training. The National Anthem being sung in your honour is a very big opportunity,” said Chepkirui who’s focussing on sharpening her speed work ahead of the competititon. Her teammate Winny Jemutai Boinnet fell in love with the sport after watching her role model Rio Olympics and former world champion Faith Chepng’etich Kipyegon. “I liked how Faith ran during the 2016 Rio Olympics. She executed the race tactically and made it look achievable for me. From there every time I watched her, the more I wanted to be like her. I hope I will be able to match her in the forthcoming championship.

She attributes her talent to her father, a former 3,000m steeplechase athlete who encourages and motivates her to be the best. The 18-year-old who hails from Burnt Forest in Uasin Gishu County wants to advance in the 5,000m and be like her role model two-time Olympics silver and World champion Hellen Obiri.
