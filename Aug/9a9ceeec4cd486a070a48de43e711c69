AFC Leopards are waiting for direction from their legal team on the simmering scuffle with Football Kenya Federation, following their Sh. 6 million fine and suspension of Chairman Dan Shikanda. Club’s National Executive Council (NEC) met on Monday and agreed to wait until they are advised further on the way forward, although Shikanda had initially declared they were headed to court. FKF on Sunday cracked the whip on Leopards and their eternal rivals Gor Mahia for boycotting Saturday’s league derby at the Thika Stadium. “We will consult and issue the statement after talking to our lawyers. We are waiting for the charge sheets now that we already have the fine and suspensions. We are waiting to get their final advice on the way forward before we take any step,” Shikanda said. The lawyers are expected to put everything together and issue their final verdict at the latest by Wednesday. “We have given them those papers (fine and suspension letters) and definitely when they are through with them they will get back to us, maybe today or tomorrow (Wednesday).
