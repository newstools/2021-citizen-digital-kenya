Log leaders Karamveer Singh Rooprai and Zameer Verjee are looking forward to this Sunday’s KCB Autocross 5 in Kilifi’s Vipingo with great expectations. Rooprai currently tops Bambino Class standings jointly with Champion Yuvraj Rajput on 78points. Rooprai has won two races so far at Kasarani racetrack in February and Eldoret in March. Champion Yuvraj has two wins from The Waterfront track in February and Jamhuri Park racetrack last month. “This weekend’s race will be a good one for many reasons. For one, I have never driven at sea level and I’m looking forward to a neck and neck showdown with Yuvraj. He has won some and I have won too, so thrills and spills are guaranteed here,” Rooprai said of his intended debut in the Coast. In the 2WD Turbo Buggy Class, Zameer savours a 29-point cushion ahead of Ankush Manoj Shah who has 57-points while Qahir Rahim is placed third on 53. Also Read: ‘I am looking forward to a great race in Kilifi. The essence now is to win more races and maintain my lead in the championship. The experience at sea level will be all good as the track in the Coast always offers us something really different and unique from what we are used to,” said Zameer. Also in the mix for Kilifi are Decko Racing team headed by Open Class Turbo driver Kirit Rajput (Subaru Impreza GC8), Peewee Class girl driver Kiana Rajput (Polaris 150cc), Bambino’s Yuvraj and quad rider Wayne Fernandes who will be piloting a Yamaha Raptor 700 up against Gurraj Singh. Leader Rajveer Thethy will renew his rivalry with Sam Karangatha in 2WD NT Car Class. Rajveer, son of former KNRC 2WD Champion Charan Thethy, has three wins under his belt. Karangatha has won only one race and will be fighting to make his presence felt in the MMC round. The 2WD Turbo log leader Azaad Manji is also expected to maintain his flawlessness. Azaad has a 78-point ahead of Pabhjeet Sagoo (62), Shaz Ismail aka Coach (54) Zuber Manji 47 and Loveyjot Singh (39). In the 4WD Turbo Car Category Rehan Shah and Sahib Omar will renew their rivalry with Asad Khan, Lovejot Singh, Eric Bengi, Salim and Hamza Anwar also looking to take the battle to the two. Hamza’s dad Asad Anwar has also signed up for the coast event.
The Quad Category will be a two-horse race between Wayne Fernandes and Gurraj Singh. Pee Wee Category will feature Kiana Rajput. The Mombasa Motor Club (MMC) round of the series will be held at Mombasa Cement racetrack in Vipingo. This year’s series started-off at The Waterfront Karen organised by Sikh Union in January, then headed to WRC Kasarani racetrack courtesy of RSC, Eldoret in March and most recently the KMSC round at Jamhuri Park.
