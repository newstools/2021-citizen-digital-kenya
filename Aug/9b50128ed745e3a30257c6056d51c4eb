The head coach of the national women rugby side, Felix Olooo had named a strong squad to face Colombia in Wednesday’s Rugby World Cup 2021 Repechage qualifier at the Nyayo National Stadium. Sinaida Nyachio, Sinaida Aura and Enid Ouma are the three notable changes to the side that ran South Africa close in last week’s 29-22 loss in Stellenbosch. Nyachio slots in at fullback with Aura featuring in a tactical change on the wing as Enid Ouma starts in the back-row replacing Sheila Chajira who has not recovered in time from an injury sustained in South Africa. With Cynthia Camila also out through injury, Janet Okello, who started the last test at fullback, moves to outside center, pairing up in midfield with Phila Olando. A fourth change, Moreen Muritu, will start this fixture from the bench. Meanwhile, Colombia have also named their squad for this fixture. Also Read: Kenya’s squad 15.Sinaida Nyachio, 14.
