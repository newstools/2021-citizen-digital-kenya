All closed sections along Mombasa Road will be opened by October 15 this year. Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) Acting Director General David Muchilwa said the JKIA-Mlolongo section will be opened on September 10, 2021. The Westlands-James Gichuru section will be opened on September 30, 2021 with the Haile Selassie-UoN Roundabout set to be opened on October 15, 2021. KeNHA added that multi-agency teams have been dispatched to control traffic. This will ensure rapid response in case of accidents, adequate and proper signage, and well-defined U-turn points. At the same time, motorists have been urged to keep within the speed limits and avoid driving on the construction site to minimize the dust. “The authority is determined to fast track the ongoing works as we assure all road users that we will continually provide adequate diversion for smooth flow of traffic,” reads part of the statement.
