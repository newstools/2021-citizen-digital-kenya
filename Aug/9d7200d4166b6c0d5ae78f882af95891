Newly appointed Gor Mahia head coach Mark Harrison says a lot has to be done to hit the standards he wants at the club, going by Wednesday’s display as he won his debut match 1-0 against Kakamega Homeboyz. According to Harrison, the performance of Gor players is still not up-to his expectation saying he will sharpen the areas he feels are not well executed. “The players are okay. They gave their all but not to my expectation. I will however have to work on some areas to ensure we can fully take control of matches,’’ said the British coach. Harrison wants to reach the group stage of the CAF Confederation, an achievement he knows requires a more competitive team than he saw in the match staged at Thika. “There is nothing to compete for the rest of this season but we are focused on the next season. We are at least want to reach the CAF Confederations Cup group stage and reclaim our league title. It calls for a lot of work.’’ Harrison’s approach can be positively compared to that of their former Brazilian coach Marcello Ferreira ’Ze Maria’ who introduced characteristic samba football into the team, as he wants “the boys to possess the ball, slow down the game at times and dictate the pace.” Also Read: His presence is already being felt after benching three of the regular starters against Homeboyz, citing lack of professionalism. “I need to be truthful. I made three changes because I had issues with their professionalism, but that is done and dusted. I don’t want to give more details on this, but we have moved on looking forward to another match,” he said. The Briton took over from Potuguese Manuel Vaz Pinto who ditched the club after securing them the sole CAF Confederations ticket reserved for Kenya. He ditched the club after being in-charge for less than seven months. Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
