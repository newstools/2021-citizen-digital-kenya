Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji has asked the court for more time to review charges in the Arror and Kimwarer dams scandal case. The DPP, through State Counsel Taib Ali Taib, told the court that the prosecution has received at least five applications from accused persons seeking review of their charges. The five, in the file that was handled on Thursday morning, include Esther Jepchirchir, Isaac Kiiru, Geoffrey Mwangi, David Walunya and Boniface Mamboleo. However, the defence led by Katwa Kigen opposed the request by the DPP to be given more time accusing the State of delaying the matter which was filed in court in 2018. He urged court to fix the matter for hearing and if there are any amendments to be made by the prosecution, the same should be done before the hearing date. Milimani Law Courts Senior Principal Magistrate Felix Kombo granted the prosecution  until September 29, 2021 to come up with a comprehensive decision on whom to prosecute and drop from the case.
