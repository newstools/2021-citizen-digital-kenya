Youthful legislators have appealed to the government to fast track modalities which will enhance the ambitions of the young people seeking to contest for political positions. Speaking during World International Youth Day on Thursday, the lawmakers said young people are often excluded or overlooked as political candidates as politics is typically regarded as a space for politically experienced men with youth being systematically marginalized because of their young age, limited opportunities, and projected lack of experience. Mwingi West Member of Parliament Charles Nguna urged the electorate not to prioritize financial muscles while choosing leaders. “It is rare to win an elective seat in Africa if you haven’t pumped a lot of resources in your campaigns. The narrative should change. Youth should be considered based on agenda, policy and not pocket ability,” he stated. His counterpart from Saboti Caleb Amisi urged the public not to label the youth as lazy but instead give them available opportunities. He further commended efforts towards expansion and widening of political space as this would enable the youths to get to leadership positions without requiring a lot of resources.

International Youth Day is celebrated annually on 12 August to bring youth issues to the attention of the international community and to celebrate the potential of youth as active partners in the global society.
