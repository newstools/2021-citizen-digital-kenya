The United States has issued a travel advisory against Kenya over Covid-19 surge and terrorism. In the notice, the US  said its citizens should reconsider travel to Kenya because the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice. In June, the CDC issued a Level 2 Travel Health Notice for Kenya due to the moderate level of Covid-19 in the country. The advisory has warned Americans to reconsider visiting Nairobi neighborhoods of Eastleigh and Kibera due to crime and kidnapping. They have also warned their citizens not to visit Kenya-Somalia border and some coastal areas due to terrorism fears “Violent crime, such as armed carjacking, mugging, home invasion, and kidnapping, can occur at any time,” reads the notice. “Local police are willing but often lack the capability to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents and terrorist attacks. Emergency medical and fire service is also limited.” Also Read: The US citizens have also been urged to consider carefully whether to use the Likoni ferry in Mombasa due to safety concerns.
