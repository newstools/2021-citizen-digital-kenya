The Co-operative Bank has registered a marginal 2.8 per cent growth in earnings through the first six months of the year having returned a profit of Ksh.7.4 billion. The growth in profitability from Ksh.7.2 billion is largely anchored on rebounding operating income having seen both interest and non-interest income grow strongly in the period. The Group netted Ksh.18.8 billion in interest earnings from Ksh.15.9 billion in June 2020 while non-interest funded income (NFI) grew by 24 per cent to hit Ksh.10.3 billion. Growth in interest income is greatly linked to the resumption of loan repayments by customers alongside increased loan disbursements in the six months. The Co-operative Bank half-year profit growth could have been greater save for higher loan-loss provisioning costs in the period. The cover for potential loan defaults was raised to Ksh.4.2 billion, doubling from a lower Ksh.1.9 billion previously.
