National men’s basketball team Morans have intensified the preparations ahead of the AfroBasket Championship that tips off from August 4 to September 5 in Kigali, Rwanda. Star player Eric Mutoro says they have been working on their strength and condition in the past two weeks to improve their endurance during the championship. “We have been training in Ngong in the last two weeks trying to get enough air in our lungs and also working on our strategy because the championship we are heading to is totally different from the qualifiers we played. We therefore can’t approach it in the same strategy we employed, we have to be different,” said Mutoro. Morans are in group C alongside Nigeria, Mali and Ivory Coast  and Mutoro says having reviewed their opponents’ video clips, they are working hard to improve on their technical ability to counter them. “We are analysing our strengths and weaknesses from the previous games and after every video session we go back to the court and rectify our mistakes. Coach Liz Mills is really bringing in a lot of good energy in the team that is really helping us,” added Mutoro. The team will leave the country on the August 20 heading to Kigali, Rwanda for the competition and the Ulinzi Warriors Captain is happy with the growing camaraderie in the squad.
