The Kenyan trio in the men’s 1500m is through to the semifinals after qualifying from the heats with Timothy Cheruiyot cruising to a second-place showing in his heat with a time of 3:36.0. Ismael Debjani of Belgium won that heat in 3:36.00, followed by the reigning world champion and Australian Oliver Hoare was third in 3:36.09. Abel Kipsang took Heat Two in a slow 3:40:68 while Charles Simotwo finished tenth in Heat Three after clocking 3:37.26. American Matthew Centrowitz, the defending champion, also sailed through after finishing second behind Kipsang in his qualifying heat with a time of 3:41.12. Fresh from winning gold in the Olympic men’s 3,000 metres steeplechase on Monday night, Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali failed to finish his heat. Cheruiyot, a late addition to Team Kenya after failing to qualify at the Kenyan Olympic trials, is the favorite to win gold. Also Read: The semifinals will be held Thursday, with the final Saturday.
