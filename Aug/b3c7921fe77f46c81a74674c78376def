The National Treasury is seeking to tap Ksh.75 billion from local borrowing through its issued September infrastructure bond (IFB). The new IFB is timed at a tenure of 21 years and will be open to investor bids until September 7. The issue is expected to attract heavy investor interests given the bond’s tax free status. The exchequer will meanwhile will be hoping to extend its smooth run in meeting its local borrowing requirements as investors continue to pack their money into government paper. This month, the Treasury scooped an easy 80.3 billion shillings to surpass a Ksh.60 billion target after investors packed Ksh.104.6 billion in August’s Treasury bond (T-bond). The greater appetites for bonds by investors have seen the Treasury remain ahead of its 2021-2022 fiscal cycle local borrowing targets.
