Hellen Wawira is determined to win a gold medal for Kenya when she takes part in the power lifting of the 41kg on Thursday. The 29-year-old who will be the first Kenyan to open the medal hunt says she has learned her lessons and from the World Cup where she finished second and says this time round she is set for the gold. “I have put in enough effort in my preparation ahead of these games. We know there are tough opponents, but I’m determined to win my country a gold medal,” she said. There is some tension that is right but my confidence is high because if I look at those we are trying to compete with most of them are ranked lower than me but I won’t underestimate them,” she explained. Kenya won a total of six medals at the last edition in the 2016 Rio Paralympics, bagging three  gold, one silver and two bronze, all coming from athletics  and the powerlifter says despite the challenges faced by many athletes because of the Corona virus they have put in enough effort in preparation to be guaranteed more medals. “I learned a lot lessons from Dubai that I believe I can use when it comes to the Paralympics games and future competitions. I will keep my head high and stay focused to achieve my aim which is to win a gold medal for my country,” she concluded.
