Police on Tuesday temporarily disrupted the burial of Mahoo Ward Member of County Assembly (MCA) Ronald Habel Sagurani in Taita Taveta County over alleged violation of COVID-19 protocols. Security officers stormed the late MCA’s home in Mahoo Ward where they dismantled tents and chased away mourners claiming they had exceeded the allowed number as per the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health. A police source in Taita Taveta told Citizen Digital that the permit issued for the burial allowed only a few people among them close family members and Deputy President William Ruto to attend the funeral. However, locals turned up in large numbers to attend the event forcing police to intervene and send some of the mourners away. The arrival of DP Ruto saw a brief service take place with only close family members representatives from the County Assembly and a section of local leaders pay their last respect. In his address, the deputy president apologised to the locals for the disruption that preceded, terming it cheap politics and disrespect to the bereaved family. He also seized the opportunity to respond to the latest remarks from President Uhuru Kenyatta wanting him to quit, with the DP stating that he is on a mission and his character cannot allow him to retreat. Also Read: “I am a man of ambition and I am on a mission I cannot retreat because my character does not allow that,” he said. The deputy president called on all leaders to work together peacefully and avoid being at loggerheads but instead focus on the developmental issues that will help change lives of Kenyans across the country.
