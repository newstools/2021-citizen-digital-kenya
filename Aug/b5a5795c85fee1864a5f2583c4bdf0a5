The qualifying week will see “the greatest number” of players and support staff on site, with organisers estimating more than 2,500 people. “This was a particularly tough decision for the USTA to make, given the immense popularity of US Open Qualifying among fans,” said organisers. “But after consulting with local health authorities and the US Open medical team, it was determined that it was the right decision to ensure the health and safety of all.” Because of Covid-19, indoor capacity at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center within Flushing Meadows has been reduced, while many of the players’ facilities have been moved outdoors during qualifying.
