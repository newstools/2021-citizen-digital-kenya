Fast foods chains in the country are not practising proper chicken handling standards which result in lower quality meat that in some cases may cause health issues when consumed. According to a report by world animal protection, giant fast foods brands like Domino’s Pizza and KFC who operate in the country the report say have extremely poor animal care and protection. Of the 5 brands found in Kenya 3, Burger King , Dominos and Subway have not scored any points while KFC and Pizza Hut scored low at 6% in better chicken commitment. World animal protection is now asking consumers to push for checks and balances as there are no regulations in the country for the sector.
