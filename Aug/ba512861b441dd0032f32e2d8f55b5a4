In a statement, World Athletics cited logistical challenges as the reason behind the change on the program for the World Junior Championships. “The impact of Covid on teams travelling and logistics of moving vital equipment around the world have proven to be a challenge,” read the statement. “However, the full athletics programme is able to be accommodated across five days rather than five-and-a-half days with minimal impact on the athletes attending from more than 100 countries.” According to World Athletics, the new schedule delivers a fuller and faster paced event with the broadcast rights for the championships having been taken up by more than 14 countries, with 12 of them showing the event live.
