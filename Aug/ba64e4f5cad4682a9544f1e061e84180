Jack Grealish scored on his home debut as Man City bounced back from defeat with a 5-0 thumping of Norwich City at the Etihad Stadium. City were unrelenting from the first whistle to the last and took the lead after six minutes, as Grant Hanley’s attempted clearance from Gabriel Jesus’ cross hit Tim Krul and went into his own net. Midway through the first period £100m man Grealish opened his City account, turning home another Jesus delivery (22), although he appeared to know little about it, and celebrated with his fingers in his ears as an apparent message to his detractors. Aymeric Laporte scored his first goal at the Etihad from Ilkay Gundogan’s corner just after the hour (64) before Raheem Sterling, dropped from Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up, scored 10 minutes after coming on as Jesus racked up a hat-trick of assists (70) with a third low ball from out wide. It took Norwich 78 minutes to muster their one and only shot of the game through winger Milot Rashica before substitute Riyad Mahrez fired in late on (84) as the Canaries’ punishing start to the season continued, while City earned a morale-boosting win to recover from their defeat at Tottenham last weekend.
