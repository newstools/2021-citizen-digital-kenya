KCB FC manager Zedekiah Otieno is already planning for next season after conceding the title race to Tusker FC. KCB  are second in the title race, three points behind the leaders who have a far superior goal difference  and the veteran tactician knows the importance of strengthening the squad with experience. “We will sit down with the technical bench and try analyse the performance of the team and also individual performance then see where we are and where we want to go next,” Zico said. Zico was impressed with the way this current squad shocked many doubters  by  mounting a strong title challenge against the football giants in the country and he hopes his side will carry the momentum into the next season which begins on the September 26. “This season has been all about hard work from the players, technical bench and the great support we have received from our sponsors. I believe if we continue with the same spirit next season with a few additional in the squad we will compete at a higher level next,” Zico added. With one game remaining Zico is convinced they will be able to get their targets right in time for the preseason for them to adjust with the rest of the squad in time ahead of the new season Also Read: “This has been a great season for the team the player have really given their best without those big names in the squad am hoping next year we will come back stronger,” the former Kenyan international added. KCB  face Nairobi City Stars  in their last game of the season and they have to score more than six goals and hope Tusker lose to Bidco United for them to have any chance of snatching the title.
