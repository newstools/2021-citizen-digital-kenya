Ugandan Olympic gold medallists will earn a monthly pay of Sh.154,584 and will have houses built for their parents in new promises by President Yoweri Museveni. Those who bagged silver and bronze will get Ksh.31,113 a month. Medallists Joshua Cheptegei, Peruth Chemutai, and Jacob Kiplimo have already received new cars. While the gifted athletes should be overjoyed, some of them are haunted by unfulfilled promises from the past, making it impossible to take the president’s word for it. According to the Monitor, the monthly stipend scheme has inconsistencies, and on several occasions, State House aides have told the media and potential beneficiaries that “it is a gift, not an entitlement, and it depends on the availability of resources.” Dorcus Inzikuru, a Ugandan athlete, was gifted a house in her hometown of Arua, as well as a car, for her gold medals at the 2005 World Championship and the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games.
