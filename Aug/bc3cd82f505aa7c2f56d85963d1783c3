Meeting Julius Yego, the Rio Olympics and 2015 World Athletics javelin champion Julius Yego, is a moment Polish javelin thrower Eryk Kolodziejczak is looking forward to, before the start of World Under 20 Athletics Championships set for August 17-22nd. The 19-year-old Polish wants to see Yego throw in person as well as train with him this weekend as promised by Yego, who is also the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games champion. “I have watched Yego throw javelin via YouTube but now that I am in Kenya, I would like to train alongside him. Yego and I share a lot in common as I also do not have a javelin coach but I know I can make it to be an Olympic and World champion someday,” said Kolodziejczak during a light training session at the Moi International Sports Center Kasarani, Nairobi on Tuesday morning. Kolodziejczak said the Under 20 event is very important to him as far as his career growth is concerned and he is targeting a podium finish come August 21. “Before or after the Championship, I would like to go on a Safari drive at the Nairobi National Park. It’s my first time in Africa and I would like to make the most of it,” said Kolodziejczak who has a personal best of 74.44m. Kolodziejczak was joined by two of his other teammates European Under 20 champion Dawid Piłat and silver medallist Tomasz Ratajczyk during the morning session to feel the environment.
