Kenya’s Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon and world champion Sifan Hassan will renew their 1500m rivalry after winning their respective semi-finals at the Olympic Stadium, in Tokyo Japan. Hassan, who edged Kipyegon at Doha Championships 2019, won in 4:00.23 to continue her pursuit of an unprecedented treble with the 1,500m and 10,000m after winning gold already in the 5,000m. Kipyegon was faster in the qualifying, cantering across the finish line in smooth fashion after winning the opening heat in 3:56.80 as teammate Winny Chebet missed out after a brutal fall took her out. She had looked solid and appeared on course for qualification before her feet got entangled with those of American Cory Ann McGee in the third lap. Ethiopian Freweyni Freweyni finished second and Canadian Gabriela Debues-Stafford was third with Jessica Hull and Nozomi Tanaka closing out the top five places guaranteed for a finals slot. Briton Laura Muir also after finishing second behind the Hassan. Linden Hall of Australia, Marta Perez of Spain and Ugandan Winnie Nanyondo are the other qualifiers on placings.

The 27-year-old was well beaten by Hassan three years ago in Doha where the Dutchwoman become the first person to combine the 1500m and 10,000m successfully at a world championship. But two years on, Kipyegon appears to be in the form of her life and turned tables on her Dutch rival at the Diamond League meeting in Monaco earlier this month, when she produced a brilliant performance to win in 3:51.07, the fourth fastest time in history. Friday’s contest looks set to open another exciting chapter of their rivalry. Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
