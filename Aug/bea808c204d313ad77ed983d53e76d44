DP Ruto however, speaking at a church service on Sunday, said the nation should not waste a lot of time debating the issue terming it inconsequential. The DP stated that he does not mind even being guarded by G4S officers, saying GSU officers should protect Kenyans and the country at large hence if that is the purpose for which they were redeployed then he has no problem. “We will make sure the nation is firm…wakulima wanatafuta…hii mambo ya GSU, AP ni mambo madogo sana tusipoteze wakati…Sina shida na AP wakikuja kusimamia mahali naishi…wale GSU kama kazi imepatikana ili Wakenya wapate usalama wacha wasaidie Wakenya pale,” he said. “Wanaweza leta hata G4S, there is no problem…tusilete migawanyiko kwa askari…tuache siasa duni….wale wanajitafutia nani mkubwa nani mdogo, haya hayasaidii changamoto zilizoko kwa Wakenya…priorities ni kujua wafanyibiashara wanapata fedha wapi.” Video Of The Day: | CHASING HOPE | KEMRI undertaking stem cell research for treatment of Leishmaniasis
