A case has been filed at the Milimani Law Courts challenging the withdrawal of General Service Unit (GSU) officers manning Deputy President William Ruto’s residences. The two petitioners; Miruri Waweru and Angela Mwikali, argue that the acts and omissions of the Inspector General of Police have compromised and threatened the security of the Deputy President, adding that the recent actions are “unreasonable and ultra vires express provisions of the Constitution, National Police Service Standing Orders and the Fair Administrative Action.” “The Petitioners fault the decision arrived at by the respondent as it was done in an opaque and arbitrary manner and there is no explanation or what criteria guided the process,” reads the petition. They further argue that the decision was politically motivated and that there’s no reasonably justifiable reason for downgrading the security of the Deputy President in a society with an established constitution and other laws and where the Rule of Law takes precedence. “The Petitioners are apprehensive that the illegal actions of the respondents are politically instigated and are meant to create a state of fear in the build-up to the general elections scheduled for August 2022,” they argue. Through lawyer Elius Mutuma, they claim that unlike GSU officers, the Administration Police are not ordinarily trained on VVIP protection. Also Read: They now want the court to order that the GSU officers return to their stations at the official or private offices and residences of the Deputy President. Inspector Geral of Police, Commander of the General Service Unit and the Attorney General have been listed as respondents.
