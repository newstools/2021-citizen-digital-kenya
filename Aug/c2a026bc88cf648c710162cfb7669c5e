Regional based insurer CIC Group has stormed back to profitability having posted earnings of Ksh.259.5 million through the first six months of the year. This to reverse a Ksh.335.5 million net loss booked in June last year. The Group’s financial turnaround is anchored strongly in the rise of investment and other income which rose to Ksh.2.6 billion from Ksh.1.2 billion, helping left the firm’s total income to Ksh.9.8 billion from a lower Ksh.8.3 billion. At the same time, CIC has trimmed its financing costs to Ksh.231.8 million from Ksh.302 million in mid-2020. Nevertheless, the Group has seen its net earned premiums remain unchanged at Ksh.7.1 billion despite a steady rise in gross written premiums to Ksh.10.8 billion from Ksh.9.3 billion. Similarly, CIC’s overall costs have swelled by 10.8 per cent to Ksh.9.2 billion. Also Read: CIC balance sheet has expanded to an asset base of Ksh.41.1 billion over the period while the Group’s asset under management have grown by 20.3 per cent to Ksh.89 billion. Subsequent to the profitability return, CIC’s earnings per share have recovered to six cents from a depressed negative 13 cents. CIC expects ongoing balance sheet re-organization which includes the disposal of non-core assets such as properties to lead to the optimal utilization of available resources. The Group is also focusing on digital investments to better customer experience. The board of CIC has not recommended the payment of an interim dividend for the period.
