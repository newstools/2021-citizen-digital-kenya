AFC Leopards’ former captain Robinson Kamura has announced he is leaving the club to join one of the top clubs in the country to seek more playing time. The central defender has not been on good terms with the Ingwe technical bench and is now set to part ways with the 12-time champions by terminating his contract that still has a year left on it. “I have not yet decided where to go but I can confirm I am leaving Leopards and as we speak already I have received offers from around three top teams in the country,” Kamura said. Kamura has however refuted claims he is on his way to join the FKF-PL leaders Tuskers FC whom he claims have already filled up his position. The defender said he finds it inexplicable that the entire technical bench at Leopards decided to sideline him. “I still have one year on my contract with Ingwe but I don’t know why the entire technical bench has sidelined me with no reason whatsoever. I am even at home as we speak now,” Kamura explained.

Leopards are sitting fourth on the log with 47 points with two matches remaining against title contenders KCB and Kakamega Homeboyz.
