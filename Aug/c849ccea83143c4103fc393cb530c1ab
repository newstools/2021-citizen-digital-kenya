Fortune Sacco failed to capitalize on National Super League leaders Football Club Talanta’s slump on Saturday against Modern Coast Rangers and take the edge off their six-point lead after they settled for a 3-3 draw against Mully Children’s Family (MCF) at the Thika Stadium on Monday. The club faithful may have deemed the outcome as a setback in their quest for the title but head coach Julius Kariuki is of the contrary opinion as he sees it as a step closer to their season ambitions. The Kianyaga-stadium based side is ranked second on the NSL log, six points adrift of leaders Talanta and three points ahead of third-placed Kenya Police who however have a game in hand. Kariuki indicates that the competitive and unpredictable nature of the  second tier league means any positive result is a plus on his side who are chasing promotion after a series of impressive results in their last seven matches. “I do not see it as a lost opportunity to close in on Talanta but a game in which we managed to come out with a positive result despite the numerous challenges that denied us victory. “What most people forget is that MCF is a very good side and they were ready to challenge us to the end. Also, rain inconvenienced us greatly as it made the pitch unplayable in every respect,” he told Citizen Digital.
