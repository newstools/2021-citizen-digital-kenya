Kenya Police FC head coach John “Bobby” Ogolla is hoping his troops will build on their last weekend’s National Super League (NSL) impressive 3-0 win over Gusii FC when they host bottom-ranked Soy United on Wednesday. After suffering a 1-0 loss against Kibera Black Stars in his first game in charge a fortnight ago, the seasoned tactician is happy to have ended Police’s poor run in the second-tier league that saw the Camp Toyoyo-based side go four straight games without a single win. The Saturday’s win got the team back on the track after they climbed third on the log with 47 points, 11 behind leaders Talanta FC and Ogolla has called for consistency from his charges to ensure they finish within the playoffs bracket. “Many players had lost confidence when I came here and was happy with the way they responded last week. “I always insist that they master the basics and become more innovative on the pitch. That is the surest path to rekindling their confidence which is essential for any ambitious side,” he revealed to Citizen Digital, when asked about the secret behind the team’s resurgence. He is, however, non-committal on his ambitions for the season with nine rounds of play to go but insists he would love his side to finish as high as they can on the log.
