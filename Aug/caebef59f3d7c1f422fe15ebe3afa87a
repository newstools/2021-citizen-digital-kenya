General Service Unit (GSU) men’s team head coach Gideon Tarus says, for now, he is focusing solely on the upcoming Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) National League playoffs despite landing the men’s national team coach role. Tarus will shoulder the responsibility of guiding the men’s national team to glory at next month’s African Nations Championships in Kigali, Rwanda after he was appointed head coach on Monday, replacing Moses Epoloto. The tactician, however, says his priority is to win the local league with the paramilitary side during the playoffs which serve off Friday at the Makande Sports Hall in Mombasa. “In a club level playoffs are very important than anything else because this is a journey we started in January and on Friday it will be the climax, so we must focus to ensure we win the league. “My boss needs title and as we speak we’re already in Mombasa. Thanks for the role at the national team but I’ll start thinking about it after Sunday when the playoffs will end,” Tarus Told Citizen Digital. In Mombasa, GSU will be eyeing to bag their fourth successive league title and 14th in total, and Tarus says he is ready for the unprecedented achievement.
