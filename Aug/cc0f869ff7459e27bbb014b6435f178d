Intriguing details have emerged on what transpired before Jonathan Mukundi, a 42-year-old businessman, allegedly shot and killed his wife before turning the gun on himself at their home in Kirigiti, Kiambu County. Family and friends have it that Mukundi and his 30-year-old wife, married for 12 years, had a rocky patch in the recent past. Close friends disclosed that Mukundi and Njeri, had separated three months ago. On Monday, August 2, Mukundi is said to have reached out to her in efforts to mend the cracks in their 12 year marriage. After having a meeting at a Kiambu Road restaurant, they parted ways only for Mukundi to call Njeri informing her that he had an accident on his way home and needed help. According to the close friends, this is how Njeri found her way to Mukundi’s house. As police continue to probe the motive behind the incident,  Njeri’s close allies suspect that she revealed that she was pregnant with someone else’s child. The lifeless bodies of the couple were discovered in the bedroom of their affluent Kirigiti residence.
