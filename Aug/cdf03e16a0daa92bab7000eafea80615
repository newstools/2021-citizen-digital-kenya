One year and three months since she was buried at her parents home in the Nyakinyua area of Uasin Gishu county, homicide detectives on Friday exhumed the body of Grace Njeri, a 12-year-old suspected to have been raped and dismembered by Evans Juma Wanjala, a self-confessed serial killer. Villagers stood in dismay as detectives dug out Njeri’s remains from her grave, her family which was not furnished with an autopsy report in May last year now hopeful that justice will be done. “Angalau tupate haki kwa sababu huyu toto tulikuwa na matumaini makubwa saana na yeye. na pia ni uchungu saana kufukua mwili wa mtu aliyezikwa mwaka jana,” Njeri’s grandmother said. “Huyu Wanjala naona ni kama hakuwa peke yake alikuwa na wengine kwasbabu huyu mtoto wangu alikuwa amekatwakatwa sana,” Njeri’s mum said. The DNA identification and the post mortem examination to be conducted is expected to firm up the case against Evans Juma Wanjala who faces five counts of rape and murder. Last month Wanjala led detectives to five scenes of crime, where they reconstructed the murders of five girls aged between 11 and 14 who fell victim to him. Wanjala is suspected to have murdered, 14-year-old Mary Elusa, 12-year-old Grace Njeri, 13-year-old Stacey Achieng, 13-year-old Linda Cherono, and 11-year-old Lucy Wanjiru.
