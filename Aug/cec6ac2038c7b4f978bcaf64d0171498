A 27-year-old man who allegedly defiled and killed a four-year-old baby in Kirinyaga two weeks ago has  been arrested by detectives. This is according to Gichugu sub-county Police Commander Anthony Mbogo, who said the suspect – Gabriel Muchira Muriithi- was flushed out of his hideout on Friday evening following investigations by detectives based in Kirinyaga East led by sub-county DCI Millicent Ochuka. The body of the little girl, a pupil at Mugumo Primary School, in Kimunye, Kirinyaga County, was discovered along the banks of River Karani on August 11, 2021. Forensic examination of the body by DCI’s Crime Scene detectives established that she had been defiled before being murdered, a fact that was corroborated by an autopsy report conducted later on. Commander Mbogo said the prime suspect following the incident has since been arrested and is being held at the Kianyaga Police Station awaiting legal procedures pending arraignment on Monday.
