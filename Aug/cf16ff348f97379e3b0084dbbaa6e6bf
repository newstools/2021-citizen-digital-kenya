Kabras Sugar head coach Dominique Habimana is optimistic of winning the Kenya Cup this season after defeating the defending champions KCB RFC in a high stakes league match at the weekend. Winning 30-23 at the Nandi Bear Sports Club, the former Kenya rugby 15s tactician said they will take each match at a time in the remaining six matches. After their weekend heroics, the western based side is second in the standings with 34 points, four points behind leaders KCB. The latter has played nine games with four left, while Kabras have two games at hand having played just seven matches. “All the 23 players that we have here have something special and I hope they’ll bring it to the party and show why they were selected so I believe they’ll give good performances and win us the league this season,” said Habimana. “At Kabras we take one game at a time and like I said we have six more matches to go and hopefully to win the title,” added Habimana. Habimana praised his side for the hard work and team work against KCB and believes they’ll put up an equal shift in the remaining matches.

KCB brought in a very experienced side including players who featured in the Tokyo Olympics led by Shujaa captain Andrew Amonde, Jacob Ojee and Vincent Onyala, Habimana saying winning against the side is a clear implication of being champions. Kabras were promoted to the top tier in 2014 and won the Kenya cup title in 2016, under Charles Cardovillis, and their weekend win was their second against KCB in a span of seven years.
