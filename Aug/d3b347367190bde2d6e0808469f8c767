National basketball team assistant coach Sadat Gaya says lack of high profile friendly matches due to the Covid-19 restrictions has affected their preparations ahead of the FIBA AfroBasket Championship. The Morans will on Saturday play Ulinzi Warriors in their first friendly before leaving the country on August 20 for Kigali – Rwanda where the championship will take place. Knowing the quality of teams they are to face in the championship, Sadat says playing tougher teams in their preparations would have sharpened them further, but acknowledged the challenge is not unique to Kenya. “The restrictions are tough in Kenya and around the world. I understand we are not the only ones affected by the pandemic but we have done our best in our preparations. Playing Ulinzi who are the best team in the country will give us a good challenge but of course you expect the national teams we take on in Rwanda to be way above in terms of quality,” he noted. Morans are in Pool C alongside Mali, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, with Sadat anticipating tough opposition in their bid to seal a second round spot. “We are trying our best to organise another friendly in Rwanda before the start of the competition but it’s not yet confirmed. This would give us some good test although we know we are in a good shape even if the championship begun today. I can say we at 70-80 percent.
