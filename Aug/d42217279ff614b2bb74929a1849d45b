Faith Kipyegon started the journey to defend her 1,500m Olympic  title on a high when she clocked 4:01.40 en route to clinching victory in the third heat of the preliminaries on Monday morning. It was another comfortable victory for Kipyegon who continued her winning streak from the Monaco Diamond League last month where she produced the fourth fastest time in history (3:51.07), also a Kenyan record. Kipyegon’s victory also keeps alive a mouthwatering clash pitting her and World champion Sifan Hassan who she beat at Monaco Diamond League. Hassan who is going for a treble at the Tokyo Games secured a semifinals berth in heat two where despite tumbling down to the ground in the final lap, she stepped on the gas to clinch victory in 4:05.17 It is on the same incident that Kenyan youngster Edinah Jebitok also fell down with only one lap to go,  but failed catch up with the qualifying group finishing 12th in the heat. But upon a successful appeal, Jebitok was cleared for the semis as she was tripped after the bell, only 400m to go.
