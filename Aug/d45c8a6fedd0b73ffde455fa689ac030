Kenya’s FIA rally stars trio of Hamza Anwar, McRae Kimathi and Jeremy Wahome are all set for the Machakos Rally scheduled for this Sunday, 29th August. The trio successfully took part in the 3rd round of the African Rally Championship (ARC) in Tanzania last month that saw Jeremy and McRae finish 5th and 13th respectively, while Anwar retired after his car experienced mechanical problems.  This is the first time Jeremy is taking part in the Machakos Rally and the second time for Mcrae and Anwar. “My expectation from every race I’m involved in is progress and improvement. I expect to improve from my performance at the ARC Rally in Tanzania. I am looking forward to the event and I am grateful to Safaricom and Kenya Airways for giving us the opportunity to hone and nurture our talent through their support for youthful drivers,” said Wahome. Jeremy and Mcrae will be giving their Ford Fiestas while Hamza will be driving a Subaru Evolution. The Ford Fiestas are sponsored by Safaricom and Kenya Airways. “This is the second time that I am entering Machakos Rally after making my rally debut four years ago. Unfortunately, I didn’t finish, that means I have some unfinished business and that is why I am determined to go back and do well. I am satisfied with the preparations we have done as a team and I am hopeful that we will do well and build up on our success in Tanzania,” said Mcrae. Scrutineering will be done at the Kenya Motor Sports Club on Saturday with the main rally kicking off on Sunday morning from the Rally Headquarters at Lisa Park in Machakos County.
