The National Police Service has downplayed concerns raised over withdraw of the General Service Unit (GSU) guard at the official residence of Deputy President William Ruto in Karen, Nairobi. In a statement to newsrooms, Police Spokesman Bruno Shioso said the change of guard was a “normal re-assignment of duties within the National Police Service to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.” He said the GSU officers deployed at Ruto’s residence had been replaced with the Security of Government Buildings Unit (SGB). “Today 26th August, 2021 the Security of Government Buildings Unit (SGB) has been deployed to provide general security to the official residence of H.E the Deputy President from General Service Unit (GSU). This is a normal re-assignment of duties within the National Police Service to enhance efficiency and effectiveness,” reads the statement. The police spokesman further noted that the Presidential Escort Unit continues to provide close protection security to DP Ruto. The deputy president’s communications secretary David Mugonyi earlier said they had not received any explanation of the change of guard which he termed as unlawful, adding that it had been extended to all of Ruto’s residences.

At this stage, no explanation has been offered for the strange and unlawful decision.
