AFC Leopards are lining up their pre-season friendly matches against Tanzanian clubs in Dar es Salaam and Namanga. Assistant coach Tom Juma has revealed that the technical bench has already forwarded the proposal to the Leopards honchos to book for these friendlies. “As you are aware we have a very short pre-season and that defines that we will be doing a lot of things here in Nairobi. But we have given the office a proposal to line up friendly matches with Tanzanian teams in Dar es Salaam if time will allow. If it will not go through then we will just remain here in Nairobi but there is also another proposal to go to Namanga and so we will wait and see,” Juma told Citizen digital. Ingwe who missed by a whisker to clinch the FKF Cup trophy thanks to losing to arch-rivals Gor Mahia on penalties, have released their players for 10 days to link up with their families before they regroup on September 2nd latest. Also Read: According to Juma, the season has been so long with a lot of challenges and so a need to relax before they return to prepare themselves for the new FKF-PL 2021-2022 new season which is scheduled to start on September 25. “We broke the camp for 10 days starting the Monday of August 23 until September 1 or 2nd so that the boys can rest after a very long season. It is good for them to have time to link up with their families and enjoy themselves out there before they return for serious business in preparation for the new season ahead of us which will start on 25th next month if we go by the schedule we have from FKF,”Juma stated. Leopards finished their league season fourth behind Champions Tusker, KCB and Bandari. Video Of The Day: | CHASING HOPE | KEMRI undertaking stem cell research for treatment of Leishmaniasis
