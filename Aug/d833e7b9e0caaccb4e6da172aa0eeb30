Kakamega Homeboyz prolific striker Allan Wanga has hung up his boots,  team manager Boniface Imbenzi has confirmed. Wanga’s retirement from competitive football brings to a halt his four-season stint with the Kakamega-based side with Imbenzi revealing that the former Harambee Stars star is keen to venture onto ‘other matters’. “There are those who are retiring like our veteran player Allan Wanga who early in the season indicated to us that immediately the season comes to an end he will quit active football. Now that the season has ended, I think he will now be venturing into other matters but inside football although in other levels,” Imbenzi said. The 35-year- old player who featured for Harambee Stars for 12 years announced his retirement from international football in July 2019 after being omitted from the Kenyan squad selected for the 2019 Arican Cup of Nations Finals which were held in Egypt. According to Imbenzi, Wanga who scored 18 goals in the 2018-2019 season has been a good example to the Homeboyz squad and a player who was not to be reminded of what to do right.

He has set a good example to the youthful players thanks to his  discipline and experience, ” he said, adding that, “Wanga is a type of player who is careful on what he does even without supervision.” He will now have time to put his focus in serving the Kakamega county government as the Sports Officer after his appointment by the County Governor Wycliffe Ambetsa Oparanya in January 2018. Homeboyz finished sixth on 46 points in the FKF Premier League 2020-2021 season after coming from behind to stun AFC Leopards 3-2 on the final day.
