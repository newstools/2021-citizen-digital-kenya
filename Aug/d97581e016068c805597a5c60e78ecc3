Kabras Sugar head coach Dominique Habimana is confident of winning this year’s Kenya Cup final as they prepare for the Saturday contest against defending champions KCB RFC. The former Kenya 15s head coach says hard work this season will help them win the championship which has been won by the Ruaraka-based side KCB for the last three straight seasons. “We’ve been working to stop KCB dominance in the Kenya Cup, so that’s why our focus was to work very hard to express ourselves and do the things that we need to do to win the championship. You have to win it in the field because nobody will give it to you for free,” said Habimana. The two sides last met last month in the regular season with Kabras coming out victorious, something that makes him optimistic of the win. “The regular season match is different compared to the final but it’s still rugby so we’ll take it as an important game but it’s still a game,” added Habimana. Also Read: “Given that it’s a final the difference is usually too little between the two, so I think that’s the kind of year for Kabras to win the championship,” said Habimana. Habimana is also confident that the match will be free and fair, devoid of the ruckus witnessed in the league encounter last month. KCB won last year’s final 23-15 against Kabras with the tense weekend finale set to be played at the Nandi Bears Sports Club from 2pm.
