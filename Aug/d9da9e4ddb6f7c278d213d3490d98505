All civil servants must now get a COVID-19 vaccine or face disciplinary action. According to a statement from the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, civil servants will now be required to get their vaccinations by the August 23 deadline. Those who do not receive the vaccine by the specified date will be classified as discipline cases and will face disciplinary action. Kinyua urged principal secretaries and accounting officers to ensure that the decision was fully implemented, notwithstanding reports that COVID-19 vaccination uptake has been poor, particularly among civil servants in security and education and other core services. “In a recent NSAC meeting, it was reported that there was a low uptake of Covid-19 vaccines among public servants especially the security sector, teachers and the core civil service,” the statement reads. The Head of Public Service contended that poor vaccine uptake has impacted public service delivery.
