Tusker FC captain Eugine Asike has warned his team mates not to underestimate Nzoia FC when the two teams clash on Wednesday at Sudi stadium. Tusker lead the table with 61 points with two games to go while Nzoia are fighting relegation and Asike knows how dangerous it can be facing such a team at this crucial time. “We have to stay focused and minimize mistakes that can cost us the title. We have worked hard throughout the season and we cannot let it go with two games,” he warned. We saw what happened to our title rivals against Vihiga United.  Nzoia are fighting to remain in the league and we want the title so we have to give everything in the remaining two games and make our fans happy,” said Asike. The brewers will be guaranteed the title on Wednesday if they get maximum points at Sudi stadium and second-placed KCB loses to AFC Leopards on the same day, something that will mean a lot to the team captain. “Most of the young players in the team have not won a title, it will be a pleasure lifting the title with them this season but as I have said it is not yet over until we win the remaining two games of the season,” added the experienced defender.
