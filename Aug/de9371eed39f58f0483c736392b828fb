Hersitone Wanyonyi won Kenya a rare gold medal in the men’s 10,000m walk race held Saturday morning at the ongoing World Under-20 Championships. Wanyonyi crossed the finish line in a personal best mark of 42:10.84 beating India’s Amit to second spot in 42:17.94 as Paul Mcgrath of Spain bagged a bronze in 42:26.11. “Though initially I was wary of my competitors but I gained confidence on the way sinceI felt my body was responding well and I realised with four laps to go I could strike a gold medal,” said an elated Wanyonyi. Wanyonyi said after grabbing the World Junior title his focus now shifts to the senior category as he eyes the 2024 Paris Olympics. “I decided to take the path of race walking since I was in primary school and I hope to make history by even competing at the highest level like the Olympics,” said Wanyonyi. Wanyonyi who turns 18 in a week’s time said he was inspired by compatriot Dominic Ndingiti who won bronze at the 2017 World Under-18 Championships before finishing seventh at the 2018 World Under-20 Championships in Tampere, Finland.
