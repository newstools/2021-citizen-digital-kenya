Talanta head coach Ken Kenyatta has hailed the invaluable support from the club’s administration led by club director Douglas Ratemo for their historical promotion to the FKF-Premier League by virtue of clinching the 2020/21 NSL title. The former Harambee Stars and AFC Leopards goalkeeper who is returning to the Kenyan top tier league after a half a decade hiatus has attributed Talanta’s success this term to a well-worked out plan that was supported by both the playing unit and the management. In his first season in charge, the seasoned tactician led the GEMS Cambridge stadium-based side that was established in 2012, to achieve their biggest feat at their sixth stab, having made failed attempts in their past six seasons in the second-tier league. “For you to win a league as competitive as the NSL, you have to plan well and also convince the management that your idea is the surest way of reaching the desired target. “I’m glad that we have achieved this feat as a group and we can only get better,” he offered. In readiness for the understandably tougher challenge in the top-tier league, Kenyatta has hinted the team will prepare well and will strengthen his squad where necessary. “We understand we have made the cut for a tougher league that will require that we up our game.

Talanta will be handed the NSL trophy next Sunday after their last game this season against Gusii FC at the GEMS Cambridge International stadium. With the fight for the title over, the battle for the remaining automatic promotion berth and playoff slot will go to the final day of the season with three teams in contention. Kenya Police are ranked second on 61 points but could surrender their narrow advantage to Vihiga Bullets who have 58 points and two games at hand should results go against them. Fortune Sacco who have endured a torrid end to the season will hope for Bullets to drop points for them to make it to the playoffs.
Elsewhere after a season to forget, the trio of Kisumu Hot Stars, Nairobi Stima, and Soy United have been relegated to the FKF-DIV 1 after failed season-long attempts to crawl out of the drop zone. NSL Round 36 Results -Silibwet 0-0 Talanta
