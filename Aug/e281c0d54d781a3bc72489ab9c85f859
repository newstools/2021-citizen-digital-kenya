The Jubilee Party National Management Committee (NMC) has formally approved a pre-election coalition agreement with the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party. The NMC, according to a statement seen by Citizen Digital, met the Parliamentary leadership on Tuesday morning for consultations, after which it granted permission to the party secretariat to engage the Raila Odinga-led party. The agreement is set to stem from the already existing good collaboration between the two parties in Parliament, as well as the working relationship of its leaders; President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga. “It is noteworthy that in the last four years, while ODM has carried its mandate as official opposition party in both the Senate and the National Assembly, the party has remained a reliable ally to Jubilee Party in the passage of all critical bills that are important for the good governance of our country,” wrote the ruling party Secretary General Raphael Tuju. Jubilee now says it will also formally write to member parties of the One Kenya Alliance seeking to engage them on the same. The party will write to KANU first, out of proper etiquette as its coalition partner, to seek their engagement on the development as stipulate in their agreement. Also Read: “The NMC and Parliamentary leadership also authorized the SG to formally write to Wiper Democratic Party with whom Jubilee Party has signed a Memorandum of Co-operation about this decision of the party that leaves the door open on further discussions with our Jubilee Party,” added Tuju. “The meeting also took cognizance of the good support Jubilee Party has received from the ANC and Ford Kenya on many occasions in Parliament.” He further added: “The SG was formally authorized to formally inform the two parties about this decision and to inform of the policy of the JP to keep the doors open for engagement premised on the spirit of fostering national cohesion within a context of mutual respect in our diversity.” Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
