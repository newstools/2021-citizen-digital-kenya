The Kenya women rugby 15s team popularly known as ‘Lionesses’ will depart to South Africa Tuesday morning ahead of their two warm-up matches against the South Africa ladies team at the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport. The ladies had weekly residential camps for the last one month which included two midweek training sessions at the RFUEA Grounds which has helped Felix Oloo and Mitch Ochola to choose 30 players. They’ll use the matches to prepare for their Rugby World Cup repechage qualifier match against Colombia on 25 August 2021 at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi. Lionesses will miss the services of Emmaculate Awuor and Janet Kerubo through injury but will be boosted by the return of eight Olympians. The matches are scheduled to be held on 12th and 16th August at the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport in Cape Town.
