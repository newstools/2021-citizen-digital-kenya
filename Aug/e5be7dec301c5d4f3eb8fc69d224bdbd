Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) presidential ticket contender Jimi Wanjigi now says the time has come for party leader Raila Odinga to exit active politics. Wanjigi said that Odinga is a Kenyan hero who has sacrificed greatly for the freedoms that Kenya enjoys today, but that the country needs fresh leadership for the next phase. “My friend Raila is a hero of the Second Liberation but his time is up,” said Wanjigi in Nyeri County after attending a church function at St Peters ACK on Sunday. The businessman also named Deputy President William Ruto and former Vice Presidents Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi among those who should exit the political arena. “There are those who have been in power for more than 30 years; my good friends Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka and William Ruto all belong there. They have nothing new to offer and its time for fresh leadership in the nation,” said Wanjigi. According to Wanjigi, Kenya is facing many problems that have emanated from current and previous leadership, ranging from social to economic.

He asked Kenyans to support his bid for the presidency saying it is premised on the desire to spur an economic revolution. “I have looked at police reports of the suicide rates from Nyeri and Mt Kenya region. Between April and August, half of suicides reported in the country came from this region. There is something seriously wrong which should even be declared a national disaster,” he said. “The Church, the State and society in general must come together to address these problems.” Video Of The Day: | CHASING HOPE | KEMRI undertaking stem cell research for treatment of Leishmaniasis
