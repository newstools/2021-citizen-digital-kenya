Goldenscape CEO Peter Wangai was Monday arraigned at the Milimani Law Courts for allegedly defrauding over 1,000 investors. Wangai, however, did not take plea after the matter was deferred to next week. He was freed on a cash bail of Ksh.10 million. Among the charges he is facing include obtaining money by false pretence by pretending that he was in a position to pay money as a return on investment for each green house after every six months. He is also facing charges of issuing bad cheques. The over 1,000 victims/investors are presented by lawyer Mutea Michael and Kennedy Wambua Mwange.
