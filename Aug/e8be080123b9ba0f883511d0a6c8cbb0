Despite their poor record in away matches, Modern Coast Rangers head coach Mohammed Mchule is optimistic they will defeat neighbours Mwatate United in their National Super League (NSL) Coast derby on Friday. Coming from weekend’s home match win against Gusii FC, Mchule says his charges are motivated ahead of the clash in Wundanyi, as they seek to escape the axe. “We rectified some mistakes from our last game and we won so we are aiming for another three points against Mwatate,” said Mchule. The former Wazito tactician has at the same time insisted that they are careful to avoid dropping points as the relegation battle heats up, having played more matches than most of their rivals. “Our target is just to escape relegation this season, and winning this derby will help us in our mission,” said Mchule. His Mwatate counterpart Andrew Kanuli is also keen on collecting maximum points, underling the need for a strong finish, in their last six matches of the season.

Thus, we are working to bag all the available points in the remaining matches.” Mwatate are currently ninth in the NSL with 42 points from 31 matches, while Modern Coast are 13th with 39 having played two more matches than their opponents. In another Super League fixture tomorrow, relegation-bound Coast Stima will host Mt. Kenya United at the Mbaraki Grounds in Mombasa.
