Kabras, on the other hand, who topped the standings, will face Strathmore Leos at the Nandi Bears Club in Nandi County. Leos finished fourth in the regular season. Leos had on Monday cried foul, claiming that the Kenya Rugby Union were out to lock them out of the semis slot despite their qualification. The finals will be played the first weekend of September.
