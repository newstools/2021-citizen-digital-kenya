Tusker FC head coach Robert Matano has been named the June FKF Premier League (FKF-PL) coach of the month. In the month, the Lion, as he is famously referred to, helped his side secure the CAF Champions League slot next season by the virtue of being top of the table by the June 30 deadline. He guided the club to win three out of the four matches played in the month and in the process saw off competition from KCB to secure continental football for next season. Tusker begun the month with a 1-0 loss to Posta Rangers at the Ruaraka Grounds, but recovered to beat Kariobangi Sharks 1-0 at Utalii Grounds before downing Western Stima 2-1 at Ruaraka. Their final and most critical match of the month ended in a 4-1 thumping of Ulinzi Stars at ASK Grounds in Nakuru, a win that helped them qualify for CAF Champions League. Matano saw off competition from KCB’s Zedekiah Otieno who came in second and immediate former Nairobi City Stars coach Sanjin Alagic to win the accolade that comes with a cash reward of Sh. 50,000 and a personalised trophy courtesy.
