Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel says he is surprised his Champions League-winning side are considered favourites to win the Premier League this season. Chelsea beat Manchester City in the Champions League final in May, but finished 19 points adrift of the Premier League champions in the table. “When you come fourth, you are not the favourites in the next season,” said Tuchel. “That surprises me because everybody who can read saw that we came fourth, and we needed some help on the last match day from our rivals to arrive in fourth place and make it in the end a successful season. “We let Liverpool pass us in the last match and we have a big gap to close to Manchester United and Manchester City. “When I see the transfer market and the activity from City and United, I don’t see why they should be any worse than last season.” Also Read: On Thursday, Chelsea spent a club-record £97.5m on re-signing Romelu Lukaku from Inter Milan.
