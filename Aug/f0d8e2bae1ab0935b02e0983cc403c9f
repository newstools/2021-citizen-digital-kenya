A police officer based at the Njoro station in Nakuru County has reportedly shot dead his girlfriend before committing suicide under unclear circumstances. According to a police report seen by Citizen Digital, 29-year-old Mary Nyambura visited the Njoro sub-county hospital with a fracture on her right leg complaining that she had been assaulted by her boyfriend, police corporal Bernard Sivo. Corporal Sivo, 28, is however said to have stormed the hospital a little while later and shot the woman several times on the right arm, right wrist, and right back as she was being treated. She died on the spot. The officer had just taken over shift duties at the Njoro Police Station that night before excusing himself to make a call outside, only to pursue the woman to the hospital. He, afterwards, went back to the station where a police report describes him as being “wild” and “firing aimlessly” thereby endangering the lives of other fellow officers. “The officers were mobilized to disarm him but unfortunately (he) shot himself on the chin and the bullet exited on the upper forehead and (he) died instantly,” read the report.
