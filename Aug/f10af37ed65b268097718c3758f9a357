Kakamega Homeboyz FC head coach Nicholas Muyoti has already shifted his focus to the next season of the FKF Premier League and is extremely keen to strengthen his defence. Speaking ahead of their match against Vihiga United, Muyoti insisted on the importance of getting into the market early so that they have all the new signings to take part with the rest of the team in the preseason. “It’s an area that we fell as a team we haven’t done really well especially considering what has happened in the last three matches ,with the short transfer window ahead, I feel we have to get into the market early so that they can be part of the team in the preseason,” said Muyoti Having lost the last three matches in the league, Muyoti has also identified some weaknesses in the team’s attack especially when missing veteran striker Allan Wanga, and he said they also need some backup plan in the striking department. “I’m very impressed by what our midfielders are doing we need some sharpness upfront  because with Wanga we have really struggled to put the ball in the back of the net hope we will get whoever we are targeting,” he added. The Kakamega based side are lying seventh in the league standing on 43 points from 30 matches.
