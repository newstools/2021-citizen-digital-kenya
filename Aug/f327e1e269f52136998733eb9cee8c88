The National Super Alliance (NASA) has formally been dissolved. Registrar of political parties Ann Nderitu confirmed the dissolution of NASA Coalition after Wiper, ANC, Ford Kenya and Chama Cha Mashinani wrote to her office announcing their withdrawal from the coalition. In a letter copied to ODM leader Raila Odinga, ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper, FORD-Kenya’s Moses Wetangula and Isaac Ruto of Chama Cha Mashinani, Nderitu noted that the resolutions of parties were executed as per set requirements. “This Office shall, in line with Regulation 22 (2) of the Political Parties (Registration) Regulations, 2019, publish a notice of the dissolution in two newspapers,” Nderitu said. According to Article 15 (1) of the Coalition Agreement, the coalition shall stand dissolved where any three of the coalition parties decide to leave the coalition.
