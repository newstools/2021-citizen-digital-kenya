The National Assembly Speaker, Justin Muturi Muturi, has urged Mount Kenya leaders not to dissolve their political parties. He warned that if the parties are dissolved, the region stands to suffer. Speaker Muturi, speaking at the Kerugoya St Thomas Anglican Church Cathedral in Kirinyaga on Saturday, said parties play an important role in power sharing. As the election in 2022 approaches, he advised the leaders to exercise caution and ensure that their parties remain united. He reminded the leaders that they could only barter for a fair division of political seats and resources if their parties stayed together. The Speaker urged those in charge of the country’s resources to maintain transparency and accountability. President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto are locked in a cold war, according to Narc leader Martha Karua. She said the two leaders were causing tension in the country and urged them to put their differences aside for the sake of peace. Mount Kenya leaders should unify, said Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri, who was also present, if they want seats in the future governments. Kirinyaga Central MP Mr Munene Wambugu echoed the sentiments, thanking President Kenyatta for the progress in his constituency.
