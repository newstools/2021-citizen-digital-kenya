Noodies, a locally manufactured noodles brand from BIDCO Africa made from plant-based ingredients, has relaunched into the market with a new improved look and taste with the aim of meeting the new needs of consumers. Speaking at BIDCO Industrial Park in Ruiru, BIDCO Africa’s Chief Value Stream Leader Tushar Mehta said Noodies as a brand developed to be consumed in every home, considered one of the quick go-to meals that are easy and convenient to prepare. “The new vibrant look and enhanced taste is bound to appeal to our customers; we have also extended the product to offer a new Kiddy pack that will excite the market and will give our young consumers the power to choose a noodles pack that is specially designed for them. We are excited to share this new experience among all customers,’’ narrated Mehta. Noodies has a one-year shelf life offering a balanced nutritional value rich in proteins, dietary fibre, carbohydrates, vitamin A, Iron and Zinc. Noodies also has thinner strands to enable better seasoning penetration thus enhancing taste. The fast-moving pace of contemporary times has seen more consumers switching to products that offer quick solutions with a healthy convenience to fit their daily lifestyles. KEBS and Halal certified, Noodies has undergone a rigorous production, quality assessment and verification process making it one of a kind in the region. BIDCO’s Quality Assurance Chemist Valentine Chebet explained: “We then pre-cook this in an elaborate manufacturing process leaving the consumer with just 3 minutes of easy preparation for a healthy, nutritious, tasty and filling meal.” Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
