COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli has faulted the government over the manner in which the General Service Unit (GSU) security guard was withdrawn at the official residence of Deputy President William Ruto. Atwoli maintains that the State ought to have formally informed the deputy president of the intended change in security guard “When it comes to the security of any Kenyan, don’t compromise. And I equally don’t support what government did. If they were to change that security they would have done it with the knowledge of our deputy president because we don’t want these lame excuses being blamed on the government because of the security of other people,” said Atwoli. He added: “What they should normally do is that they will come and discuss with you and tell you ‘we are trying to change these officers for this reason’…. You should not come home and find new faces in your home. You might even run away from that home.” On Thursday, GSU officers deployed at Ruto’s Karen residence were replaced with officers from the Security of Government Buildings Unit (SGB) a move that sparked heated reactions. The Office of the Deputy President termed the change as unlawful and maintained that Ruto had not offered any explanation for the decision.
