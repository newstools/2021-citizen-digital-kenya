Kenya asserted her dominance over the 3000m steeplechase race as Jackline Chepkoech and Faith Cherotich bagged gold and bronze respectively at the ongoing World Under-20 Championships in Kasarani. Chepkoech made her intentions clear from the onset when she went for an early lead proving too strong for her competitors as she crossed the finish line in a personal best of 9:27.40. The battle for silver had narrowed down to the duo of Ethiopia’s Zerfe Wondemagen and Kenya’s Faith Cherotich with the former prevailing to finish second in 9:35.22 as Cherotich took bronze in 9:44.76. Chepkoech successfully defended the title won by her compatriot Celliphine Chespol at the 2018 Championships held in Tampere, Finland.
