Kenyan attacking midfielder Mohammed Katana popularly known as Messi Agege has joined Swedish division one side Vasalunds IF on a five-year contract. Speaking after completing the transfer after four months in the cold, the former Isloch and Bandari FC player said his target is to work hard to help the team get promotion to the top tier. “I just want to go and help the team avoid relegation and then target promotion next season,” said left-footed Katana. Agege added that Gor Mahia approached him after parting ways with Isloch but the negotiations were not successful. “When I returned from Belarus Gor Mahia came calling but nothing went on,” he added. The 21-year-old is expected to leave the country anytime to link with his new team as the Swedish league is already in session. Agege had been training with FKF Premier League side Bandari FC in Mombasa as he worked on the deal. The Aspire Academy graduate is also targeting another call-up to the national team Harambee Stars after he was called up by coach Francis Kimanzi last year when Stars played Chipolopolo of Zambia in a friendly match. He was an unused substitute during the game. His only national team match was in 2017 with the under-20 team,  against Senegal away, in an Africa Cup qualifier. “I would love to return to fitness and form and of course donning my national team jersey is still my target as Kenya targets World Cup 2022.” Other Kenyans who have played for Vasalund include Erick Marcelo Ouma who is now with AIK in the Swedish top tier and Ovella Ochieng. The Stockholm based club plays their matches in the 5,200 seater Skytteholms IP stadium Vasalunds IF arecurrently 15th in a 16 team league with 16 points after 16 rounds of matches.
