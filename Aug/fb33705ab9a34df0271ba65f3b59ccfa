Handeni District Commissioner Toba Nguvila, who talked to the media after the recently concluded breast-feeding week, brought the issue to light. The commissioner said men breast-feeding has stood out as a severe concern while meeting women during the week, which is normally commemorated between August 1 and August 7. “Jambo ambalo limeibuka ni kuwa kina mama kulalamika kwamba wa-baba wananyonya mazima,” Nguvila said According to the commissioner, the vice derives from a misguided assumption that breast milk improves sexual performance, which has left children in some areas severely underweight, spouses defenseless, and men hungry. “Jambo hilo linatokana na imani kuwa maziwa haya yanaongeza nguvu fulani,” the commisioner told Millard Ayo TV Also Read: While unusual, the practice of men drinking breast milk is not new.

When asked if he was concerned that the mother would become exhausted or that the infant would not receive the milk it deserved, one man replied, “If you feed a cow well, they produce a lot of milk.” I take good care of my wife.’ Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
