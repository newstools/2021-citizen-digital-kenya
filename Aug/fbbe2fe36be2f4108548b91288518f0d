Ulinzi Stars head coach Benjamin Nyangweso has unleashed a warning shot at AFC Leopards to prepare for an upset when they clash in the Premier League clash in Nakuru tomorrow (Thursday). The Military side are, however, aware that Ingwe are in good shape having drubbed bottom of the table side Vihiga United 3-1 over the weekend hence Nyangweso will definitely not underrate the Patrick Aussems-coached side “We are well organized although we are very much aware AFC (Leopards) are in such good form and in a winning mentality after collecting maximum points in their last outing. “So we just prepare as we do prepare for other matches but for a fact we are very cautious because tomorrow’s game against them will not be an easy one,” Nyangweso opined. The Soldiers have not beaten the twelve-time champions for some time but despite the stats, Nyangweso is hoping to put their head to head results and focus on reaping out of this tie. “As you know every team has their own day to win against any opponent and when you prepare your boys you obviously expect to go into a match and win but results might not favour your expectations. Also Read: “Nevertheless, we can’t put our bad outings against Leopards in mind and tomorrow is a very different day all the same and it will depend on how well one is prepared,” Nyangweso recorded. Ulinzi are sitting in position 10 with 41 points and could jump up to seventh on the same points with fourth-placed Nairobi City Stars, Leopards who are third as well as Kariobangi Sharks due to inferior goal difference should they collect maximum points. Both teams are aiming to finish stronger this season with only three matches on cards to play for pride and a respective position with Ingwe fighting for position three and Ulinzi having a top five slot possibility.
