Gladys Wanga, the Homa Bay Woman Representative, has joined the growing list of leaders calling for Deputy President William Ruto’s resignation. Wanga said during the burial of the late Margaret Alai in Kisian, Kisumu, that one cannot have his cake and eat it, adding that if Ruto is man enough, he should resign and fight the government from outside. Wanga told mourners in Kisumu Ruto should resign saying he cannot critise the same government that he is still serving. Her Kisumu counterpart Rosa Buyu said the fall of BBI is not the end of everything stating that the ODM party leader Raila Odinga has already given direction of forging ahead focusing on 2022 politics. The calls for resignation come just days after President Uhuru Kenyatta accused his deputy of double speak. In a meeting with the country’s senior editors on Monday, the President asked his Deputy to resign if he becomes tired or dissatisfied with the government’s functions.
