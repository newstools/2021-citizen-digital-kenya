Law  Society of Kenya (LSK) President Nelson Havi has accused Muthangari Police Station OCS of allegedly interfering in the internal affairs of the organization. According to Havi, the OCS has consistently dispatched two police officers to the LSK offices under strange circumstances. He said the officers on Monday prevented them from holding a meeting after reportedly locking up one of the board rooms where they were scheduled for a sit down. Havi has now urged the Inspector General of of Police Hillary Mutyambai to oversee dispatch of the officers to other areas of actual criminal concern in the country. “What really, is the interest of the OCS Muthangari Police Station in the internal affairs of the Law Society of Kenya? These officers are permanently stationed at the LSK Headquarters on orders from “above,” he stated. “Today, they locked up the Board Room and prevented the holding of a lawful meeting at the Headquarters of the Law Society of Kenya.” Also Read: He added: “IG, there are many more pressing matters of criminal nature where the National Police Service should focus on. Internal management of affairs of the Law Society of Kenya does not require police supervision. LSK is not a parastatal.” The LSK boss, in a series of videos he posted on social media, is seen confronting the two officers, asking them to exit the premises. They, however, decline to leave, only saying that they are attending to an “assignment.” What really, is the interest of the OCS Muthangari Police Station in the internal affairs of the Law Society of Kenya?
