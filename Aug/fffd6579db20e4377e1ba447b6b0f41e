Kenya’s basketball men’s team Morans warmed up for the upcoming 2021 FIBA Afrobasket Championship scheduled to take place from 24th August to 5th September in Kigali, Rwanda with a pivotal 75-72 win over Ulinzi Warriors in a build-up match Monday evening at the Nyayo Gymnasium. Morans  took control of  the first three quarters winning 17-12, 19-18 and 17-10 respectively before the soldiers turned things around to dominate the last quarter  32-22 but it was too little too late. Morans’ assistant head coach Sadat Gaya says the match was important for them to know which areas to work on. “When players have such a match it gives technical bench room to understand how they are and which areas need to be improved, their weakness and strength. We have areas which we need to work on and I believe we shall get it right, especially our defensive and offensive systems,” he said. On his part Warriors head coach William Balozi said it was an important match as they used it as part of their preparations for the BAL Championship and have learnt a lot of lessons. “We have learnt a lot from them including their rotations, good preparation for us for the BAL Championship,” Balozi said.
