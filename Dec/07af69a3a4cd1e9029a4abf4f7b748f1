 Preparations for the Azimio la Umoja national
convention have intensified in Kasarani with organisers saying the venue will
be ready for use by Thursday morning. ODM and Jubilee party MPs inspected the venue
on Tuesday before a security mop-up takes place on Thursday. “We’re expecting 60,000 people…we hope they
will not be more because this stadium can only carry that,” said ODM Chairman John
Mbadi. Nominated Senator
Maina Kamanda said: “Hakutakuwa na invitation cards na wale watakuja zaidi ya 60,000
watakaa nje na watafuatilia kila kitu Baba anasema hapa ndani.” Five delegates have already been identified
in each ward across the country and will start arriving in Nairobi on Thursday. “Tumealika governos zaidi ya 40…na kufikia
leo governors zaidi ya 30 wameconfirm,” said National Assembly Minority Whip
Junet Mohamed. With the event set to host 60,000 people, COVID-19
protocols are of concern. “Kila mmoja
anapokuja awe ameweka barakoa yake, kwa sababu kuna new variant ambayo
imetokea,” said Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati.  Kasarani gates will open at 5am on Friday.
