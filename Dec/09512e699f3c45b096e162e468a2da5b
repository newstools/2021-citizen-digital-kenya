 The Kenya Meteorological
Department has cautioned of continued heavy rainfall expected in some parts of
the country that may lead to potential floods towards the end of the month. In a statement on Friday, the
weather department raised concerns for residents around parts of Central Kenya,
Southeastern lowlands, Northern and Coastal areas saying the areas would
continue to receive moderate to high rainfall. “The rainfall being experienced
over several parts of the country is expected to continue up to Monday 20th
December 2021,” read the statement. “It is likely to intensify to
more than 30mm in 24hrs on Tuesday 21st December 2021 in Central region
including Nairobi area, Southeastern lowlands, parts of Coastal and
Northeastern region.” Counties in the Central Region
affected include; Embu, Meru, Murang’a, Nairobi, Nyeri, Kiambu, Kirinyaga and
Tharaka Nithi. Counties in the Coastal regions
affected include; Tana River, Taita Taveta, parts of Mombasa, Kilifi and Lamu. Other regions are the
Southeastern lowlands (Machakos and Makueni) and Northern Kenya counties
(Isiolo and Garissa). Even though by Wednesday the
downpours may subside in the mentioned regions, residents are still cautioned
of strong winds of more than 15knots (7M/S). “The moderately strong winds may
blow off roofs, uproot trees and cause structural damage,” MET  warned. The weatherman thus
implored those living in lowlands especially downstream where rains are
moderate to watch out for floodwaters. “Avoid driving through, or
walking in moving water or open fields and not to shelter under trees and near
grilled windows to minimize exposure to lightning strikes,” noted the
statement.  At the same time people living in
the Central highlands especially on the slopes of the Aberdare ranges and Mt.
Kenya areas known to be prone to landslides are urged to be watchful.
