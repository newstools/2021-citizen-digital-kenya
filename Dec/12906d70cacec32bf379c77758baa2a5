 Police in Mombasa are holding in custody a woman suspected
of intoxicating victims before swindling them of their belongings. The suspect, Joyce Aluta, was cornered by members of the public at Kisimani area in Nyali on Thursday night, just a few hours past midnight. According to reports by witnesses, Aluta has been
intoxicating her victims before stealing their personal items such as mobile phones, watches, shoes
and wallets. “The woman who poses
as a sex worker has been intoxicating her clients then robbing off their
belongings such as mobile phones, watches, shoes and wallets,” Abdalla
Abdulrahman who exposed the woman stated. Abdulrahman further explained that Aluta would at times
pose as a prostitute then lure her customers to their homes then get away with equipment
such as TV sets, radio and computers after drugging them. Police have since recovered three mobile phones, a hand watch, shoes and money from the suspect.  The suspect is behind bars awaiting arraignment.
