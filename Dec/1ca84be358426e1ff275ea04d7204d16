 Police in Homa Bay County have arrested two
suspects and recovered four crude weapons following an incident where 18 cows
were killed and 120 others seriously wounded by unknown people in Ndhiwa on
Sunday. The suspects were arrested in a joint raid
conducted by security officers from Ndhiwa Police Station in more than five
locations within the area. The incident left more than 30 livestock
farmers in the affected location counting huge losses after unknown suspects stabbed
the animals in an attack whose motive has not been established. Homa Bay County Commissioner Moses Lilan confirmed
that the two suspects were apprehended early Monday morning and taken to Ndhiwa
Police Station for further interrogation before they are arraigned in court. Lilan said the two are the main suspects police
have been following since Tuesday last week after a similar attack was carried
out in Waondo and Kayanja sub-locations, Mbita sub-county, where 32 cows were
killed and 59 others injured. Lilan revealed that they are following crucial
leads aimed at ensuring other suspects linked to the heinous act are arrested. During the arrest, police recovered four
weapons - one spear and three pangas - believed to have been used by the
suspects to attack the animals. The county commissioner called on members of
the public to volunteer any information they have regarding the attack to
assist in the ongoing investigation. He added that the probe will be extended to
Kisumu and Migori counties where they believe other suspects are hiding.
