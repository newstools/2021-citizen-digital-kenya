Milly Nafula, a 32-year-old who has waited to join university for 14 years despite scoring an A- (minus), can now rest easy. Two days after her plight was highlighted by Citizen TV, Nafula has received a scholarship to pursue her dream at Mt. Kenya University. Mt. Kenya University Chairperson Simon Gicharu said the institution will fully cater for Nafula’s academic expenses. For 14 years, Milly Nafula has held on to her dream of becoming a medical doctor. The 32-year old excelled in her Kenya secondary school examination in 2007 with a mean grade of  a- of 71 points. At that point she believed that the future was bright and her hope was that she would soon be limiting her family out of poverty. But she unfortunately missed out on a university spot and despite consistent follow-up she has been unsuccessful in joining a tertiary institution. Raised by a single mother, who struggled to make ends meet and put her through school, there was hope that Milly would join university and raise the family's prospects. Her mother died in 2012. Milly says she had knocked on every Education office, and written a letter to the district education officer. In a letter dated 28th June of 2011, written by the District Education Officer, addressed to the principal at Manor High School, where Milly was a student, the DEO writes: “Naturally, the candidate qualified for university admission for a regular degree programme which she has not realised to date. We recently wrote to the joint admissions board drawing their attention to the plight of the candidate.” The DEO further requested to be furnished with a letter from the school which forwarded the university application forms with the attendants' list to confirm that Milly actually applied and her form was duly submitted.
