Dubai has suspended all air transport services with inbound and transit passenger movements to the emirate of Dubai from any point in for 48 hours effective from December 20. A statement by  Emirates says the suspension was in line with a  directive from the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA "Customers will not be accepted for travel on Emirates flights at Nairobi during this time," the carrier said on Monday. "Outbound passenger operations from Dubai to Nairobi remain unaffected." Those affected by the suspension will not be required to call the airlines immediately. They are advised to hold on to their tickets and redeem them when the suspension is lifted. "Customers can simply hold on to their Emirates ticket and when flights resume, get in touch with their travel agent or booking office to make new travel plans," the statement adds.
