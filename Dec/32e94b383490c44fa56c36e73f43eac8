 68-year-old Godfrey Jjemba Matte became an internet phenomenon in December after photos of him holding sheets of paper and a microphone at what seemed to be a village event went viral. Matte, a revenue collector at the markets around his Mbulakati village home in Kayunga district, Uganda, says he had attended a funeral and no one was ready to read out the announcements and he volunteered to. The mourners were impressed by his prowess and he started getting invited to funerals to read announcements. “I was assisting and I am still assisting… I started it jokingly because when I was in school I was a debater so this was so simple because I could stand and elaborate everything to the congregation,” Matte told NTV Uganda recently. He says he is now a sought-after funeral announcer in the region. So in demand, Matte says, that people resort to booking his services through his wife's phone or the area councillor because he does not have a phone. Despite his coveted services, the patriarch says he does not charge for his services and leaves it to the mourners to give him ‘water’ for work well done. ‘Water’ in this case being anything between 10,000  and 1 million Ugandan shillings (Ksh.319 - 31,000). “If one talks for a long time, the throat gets tired so they have to give me some water depending on how I perform.” Since becoming an internet sensation, Matte says he has had to come to terms with strangers; fans, potential clients and journalists alike paying him impromptu visits just to see him or speak to him. The more he speaks to the press, the more the visits escalate, case in point being a December 28 story with local tv station NBS which saw people flocking to his home to give him holiday presents and take pictures with him.
