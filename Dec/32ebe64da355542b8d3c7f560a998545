 The President Uhuru Kenyatta-led ruling Jubilee
Party has made three changes to its Kiambu County Assembly leadership. This follows the suspension of MCAs Simon
Karema (Theta), Gideon Gachara (Ndeiya) and Anne Wanjiku Kariuki from their
positions in the Assembly on December 3, 2021. The three were part of 15 MCAs suspended from
the House activities for a period of 90 days by Speaker Stephen Ndicho over
disorderly conduct. They were accused of storming the House armed
with hammers, chains, and locks and disrupting a board meeting on December 2. Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju, in a
letter to Speaker Ndicho, said the three had since been replaced with MCAs Elijah
Njoroge, Peter Muhindi Kioi, and Cecilia Njuguna. “The Party regrets that our House leaders
could orchestrate such violence and disruptions during the Assembly sitting as
against the Party principles of tolerance, consultations and the humane
doctrine set out in the Party Code of Conduct,” said Tuju. Mr. Njoroge now takes over from Mr. Gachara
as the Leader of the Majority, while Mr. Kioi replaces Mr. Karema as Majority
Chief Whip, and Ms. Njuguna steps into Ms. Wanjiku’s shoes as Deputy Majority
Party Leader. The party however resolved to retain Margaret
Mwago to continue serving in her capacity as Deputy Chief Whip, with the changes
taking effect immediately.
