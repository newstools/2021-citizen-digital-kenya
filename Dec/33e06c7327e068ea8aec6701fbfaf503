President Uhuru Kenyatta has strongly castigated child molestation and called on Kenyans to unite in condemning the perpetrators of the vice in society. Speaking in Nakuru during the World AIDS Day celebrations on Wednesday, President Kenyatta termed child molesters as a threat to the country’s future well-being. “Ni aibu sana kwa sisi wazee na viongozi kuskia watoto wetu wakilia kwa sababu ya tabia zetu. Ni aibu kubwa. Ni vizuri tuanze kuambiana ukweli, kwa sababu sio watoto wanajiharibu, ni sisi wazee tunaharibu watoto,” said President Kenyatta. “Wewe kama mzee unatembea na mtoto mdogo hata kuliko msichana wako, alafu ujiite mwanaume, wewe ni mwanaume wa saa ngapi? Si uende utafute mwenzako kama umechokeshwa na yule uko naye nyumbani? Enda utafute rika yako uwachane na watoto jameni!” added the Head of State. Kenyatta further called for societal condemnation of the vice, saying the fight against sexual violence should not be left to authorities. “Ukijua uko na mzee ana hizo tabia, muweke kwa soko umuanike hapo mbele ya watu wamuangalie, hiyo aibu ndiyo itafanya aache hiyo tabia,” he stated. “Hata tukisema atakaye shikwa afungwe, hiyo haitasaidia. Ile itasaidia ni sisi tubadilishe tabia zetu,” added President Kenyatta. Kenyatta's speech followed moving testimonies by two young Kenyans who shared their experience with teenage pregnancies; Peter Mwaura, whose mother got pregnant with him aged 14, and Adunya Khadija, who got pregnant at 19.
