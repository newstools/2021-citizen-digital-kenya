 Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila
Odinga has hit out at Deputy President William Ruto accusing him of attempting
to sell lies to the Kenyan electorate. Odinga, speaking on Thursday during a private visit to the home of Erastus
Okul at Komolo Lwala Village in Homa Bay County, warned
Kenyans to be cautious with the DP likening him to a wolf in sheep’s clothing. According to the ODM leader, DP Ruto has
disguised his true nature through an outward show of innocence. “Mimi nimejaribu sana kutahadharisha Wakenya.
Kuna yule fisi ambaye amejivisha nguo ya kondoo, anajifanya ni kondoo. Sasa siku
hizi hatoi sauti kama ya fisi, amebadilisha ili mmfungulie mlango, akifunguliwa
mlango kutakuwa na shida,” Odinga said. The former Prime Minister further criticized
Ruto for what he intimated was mixing politics with religious affairs. The DP has in the past taken his campaign
trail to a number of religious establishments all over the country in an effort
to augment his following for his 2022 presidential bid. “Anajaribu kuhadaa Wakenya kusema ati mimi ni
mkristo. Kila Jumamosi au Jumapili anaingia kwa kanisa. Ati huo ni
Ukristo? Huo ni ufisi!” Odinga stated. Odinga similarly criticized DP Ruto’s
bottom-up agenda insisting that Kenyans are smart and cautious enough to avoid buying
into the politician’s falsehoods; he instead advocated for his Azimio la Umoja
vehicle. “Kuna watu wengine ambaye wanapinga sera
zetu. Wanadanganya Wakenya na wanajaribu kuhadaa Wakenya na mambo sijui ya
bottom-up. Hawa ni watu ambao hawajui pale wanatoka na kule wanataka kuelekea.
Sisi tunasema tuko na sera kamili na yetu inakuja kupitia kwa mlango ya Azimio
la Umoja,” Odinga said.  “Hawa wengine wanajaribu kuwahadaa wakenya.
Maneno ya uwongo ambayo haina maana na wale wanajulikana. Juzi wanasema ati
watu watu waling’oa reli Kibera. Reli ambayo ilingolewa ilikuja baadaye
ikarekebishwa.”
