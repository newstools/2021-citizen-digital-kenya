 Kirinyaga Woman Representative Purity Ngirici
has hinted at vying for the county’s gubernatorial seat on an independent
ticket come next year’s general elections. Ngirici, a long-time ally of Deputy President
William Ruto, has been vocal about her intention to challenge Governor Anne
Waiguru for the seat next year. Her bid to usurp Waiguru was however dealt a
heavy blow in November after the current governor decamped to the DP Ruto-led
United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party from Jubilee, in a bid to defend her
seat at the 2022 polls. Ngirici, speaking in Kiamagumo area in
Gichugu constituency during the burial of a slain assistant chief on Thursday, advised
the Kirinyaga electoratee to look at individuals when they’re
casting their votes and not the political vehicles they’re affiliated to. “Leaders attract followers, they don’t follow
them. They attract them. I will be vying for Kirinyaga County’s governor seat at
next year’s general elections,” Ngirici said. “I would also like to remind those
individuals joining different parties that the people of Kirinyaga will elect
the person and not the party.” She similarly noted that, in the past,
Kirinyaga residents elected some leaders on independent tickets because they
were not satisfied with their political party affiliations. "During a previous election period, you elected
an MCA on an independent ticket because you were not pleased by the one who was
endorsed by the party you were following,” stated the Woman Rep. “So, even now, don’t look at the party; look
at what the individual brings to the table in terms of development and leadership.” Ngirici’s utterances allude that she could
possibly decamp from UDA, leaving Waiguru as the only contender for Kirinyaga
County’s gubernatorial seat under the party.
