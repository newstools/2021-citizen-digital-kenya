 The family of Tom Okwach is still grieving 22
days after a mining shaft collapsed in Abimbo, Siaya County, trapping him under
the rubble. The 22-year-old Okwach’s mother, Joyce Ochola
Ogunde, now says that her family has been left in anguish after the excavator
brought to help with rescue efforts ceased operations. This was the second excavator brought in by
the county government to help with the operation. The pain-struck mother has also revealed that
even the committee formed to spearhead the rescue operation and locals who were
helping in the rescue mission have since developed cold feet. Okwach’s sister, Janet Atieno Nyunja, has
since pleaded with the national government to bring in more experts to help in
retrieving their kin whether dead or alive. According to Nyunja, it is quite unfortunate
that local miners have since resumed duties and routine mining operations when
Okwach is still trapped inside the collapsed mines. Her sentiments were shared by Pamela Akelo, a
former County Executive Committee member for Education in Siaya, who equally
called on the government to conclude the recue as soon as possible. Akelo at the same time insisted that Okwach’s
family members should be provided with counselling, noting that they are
currently going through a traumatizing period. Okwach was among the eight miners who were
trapped after the mining shafts collapsed on December 2, 2021.  Six miners have since been rescued while one
passed away during the incident.
