 Police
have launched investigations into the alleged abduction of Deputy President
William Ruto's digital strategist Dennis Itumbi. In
a statement released on Friday, National Police Service (NPS) Spokesperson Bruno Shioso said they
will be seeking to establish circumstances surrounding the incident. He
appealed to members of the public who may have information on the same to
report to any police station or their hotline numbers. Police
said the matter had since ben reported at Thindigua Police Post and booked
under OB number 10/23/12/2021. Itumbi
went missing on Thursday afternoon after he was reportedly picked up by
unknown men at Thindigua in Kiambu County. The controversial blogger is said to have
been forced into a Toyota Premio vehicle after leaving a barbershop. Witnesses
told Citizen TV that three
well-built men approached Itumbi and bundled him into the backseat of the
vehicle before driving off towards Nairobi. Itumbi's
brother, David Itumbi, took to Twitter to announce that they had found him at a Nairobi hospital along Thika Road, though badly beaten. According
to David, the digital strategist told them that he had been arrested and
tortured by police officers.  "My
brother has been badly beaten. We thank God that he is alive. On his own
account he was arrested by police and beaten and tortured. This is the state we
found him in. Please pray for his recovery," wrote David, as he attached
photos of Itumbi in a hospital bed with injuries on the eyes and mouth.
