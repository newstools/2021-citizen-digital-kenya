 Five teenagers have been arrested in connection to a series of robberies that have hit the affluent Nyali suburbs of Mombasa. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) rounded up the gang after saving one of the members from a rowdy mob that almost lynched him. "The Mtwapa-based crime busters came to the rescue of 19 year old Bakari Juma Saidi alias Abu, who locals had linked to several robberies in Kadzandani area," said the DCI in a statement. “Bakari was rescued from the jaws of the angry mob, that had already administered instant justice to the suspect, leaving him with life threatening injuries." Bakari's encounter with the detectives aided to a lead that helped the capture of the other four. "As the sleuths rushed him to hospital for treatment, they obtained crucial leads that later led them to the suspect’s accomplices, in Kiembeni Bobo area where more arrests were made," added the statement. The other four are: 19-year-old David Juma aka Devido, an ex convict of Shimo La Tewa prison, Marriam Ali aged 18, Kamanzi Kikoba aged 18 and a 17 year old juvenile locally known as 'Bibi ya OCS', married to a notorious wanted criminal known as Ali alias 'OCS'. The suspects were booked and are facing various charges amongst them robbery and assault.
