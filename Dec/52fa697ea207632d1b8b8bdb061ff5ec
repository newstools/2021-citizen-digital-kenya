Deputy  President William Ruto will be in Narok on Friday, with his day beginning at Olorropil at around 9a.m. He'll then travel to Turkana, where he'll pitch a tent for two days to promote his 'bottom-up' economic model, which his camp promotes as the panacea to Kenya's long-standing problems. His Turkana visit will start at the Tobong'u Lore Cultural Festival from midday Friday. Meanwhile, ODM leader Raila Odinga will be in Kasarani, where he will announce his presidential candidacy in front of 60,000 invited guests. The former Prime Minister has previously said he has the blueprint to deal Kenya's current problems which range from graft to unemployment, under the Azimio La Umoja tenet. On Friday, planners of the event expect him to make a big declaration on the 2022 General Election, for which he is yet to announce himself as a contender.
