 Legislators allied to Deputy President
William Ruto have said the suspension of the Political Parties Amendment Bill
of 2021 was a big win for Kenyans. South Migirango Member of Parliament Sylvanus
Osoro said MPs opposed to the Bill were against the creation of an imperial
registrar of political parties who has the power to decide if one is a member
of a party or not. Osoro said they will not support a bill that
would undermine the rights of Kenyans, dismissing claims that it was all a show
of might. “We are not in competition of personalities;
we are in competition of ideas for the betterment of this country,” he said. Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika said proponents
of the bill did not follow the right procedure, citing lack of public
participation. “We cannot allow laws that are brought
without following the right procedure,” said Kihika, while lauding MPs who
opposed the bill. “I
want to congratulate my colleagues for a great job you did yesterday, we love
it when you stand up to these people,” she stated. They spoke in Ngata, Nakuru County, during
the burial of Ambassador Ken Osinde, the late Chief of Staff in the office of
the deputy president. The burial was also attended by DP Ruto and
MPs Liza Chelule (Nakuru), Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango) and Shadrack Mose
(Kitutu Masaba). Dr Ruto eulogized Amb. Osinde as an
outstanding team leader who has left a huge gap in public service. The DP said Kenyans will soon enjoy Universal
Healthcare Coverage (UHC) once the bill is signed by President Uhuru Kenyatta
into law. He said the scheme will make it possible for
very Kenyan to access quality healthcare without worrying about cost of
treatment. “Majority of people delay going to hospital
because they are not sure of how they are going to pay their hospital bill,”
said Ruto.
