 A man from Bondeni, Mombasa County, on
Thursday allegedly hacked his father to death then stuffied his remains in a
sack. The suspect is said to have chopped his
father’s lifeless body into pieces, before forcing them into a sack and dumping
it behind a local mosque. The deceased has only been identified as
Nagib. The victim’s body was discovered by residents
on Saturday owing to the smell emanating from the sack. The suspect, who is said to be mentally
unstable, has since gone into hiding and a police manhunt is currently underway
to bring him in.  The body of the deceased has since been moved
to a nearby mortuary.
