 President Uhuru Kenyatta
announced that the newly-constructed Uhuru Gardens Museum will be accessible to
the public free of charge from April next year. The
Head of State, speaking during the national Jamhuri Day celebrations on Sunday, revealed that the
construction of the museum will be a masterpiece that will integrate culture,
the present and the history of the nation. “This
place will be an arena where the past, the present and the future will
converge. When Kenyans walk through the Heroes Boulevard, their spirits will be
edified by the sacrifice our liberators made,” said the President at the event
in the Uhuru Gardens. “At
the end of the boulevard, there will be the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior; a
warrior whose name we do not know although he died in battle for our country
and a warrior whose mother let him go and so both mother and son sacrificed so
that we can be free.” President
Kenyatta also revealed sections of the museum called the 'Hall of Legions'
and the 'Tunnel of Martyrs' that will honor the nation's pioneers including the
father of the nation, the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. “At
the Hall of Legions, it will bring alive our legendary ancestors, including
Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, Mekatilili wa Menza, Koitalel Arap Samoei, Jaramogi Oginga
Odinga, Nabongo Mumia, Laibon Lenana, Dedan Kimathi, among many others,” he said. “At
the Tunnel of Martyrs, we will have a solemn memorial to each and every Kenyan
who has lost their lives in the many watershed moments. This will change from
World War I and II, all the way to the victims of the post-election violence of
2008.”  He
further stated: “Once completed, the historical avenue will rekindle memories
of the nation's armed struggle. A culmination of the good, the bad as well as
the ugly of Kenya's history. The Hall of Innovation will celebrate the
brilliant game-changing ideas produced by Kenyans.”
