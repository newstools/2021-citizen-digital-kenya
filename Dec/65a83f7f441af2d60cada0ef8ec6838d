Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha has encouraged schools to embrace the vaccination of students above the age of 15 to help in the fight against spread of the coronavirus. CS Magoha said the National Government, through the ministry of health, had approved vaccination of those aged 15, whom he says is the majority in schools. The CS said schools should liaise with the department of health to carry out vaccination exercises in schools for teenagers, but at their will. Speaking in Kisumu when he visited the Maseno school, CS Magoha said the vaccine works and dismissed those thinking otherwise and shying away from being jabbed. "You students have suffered greatly. We know and appreciate that, but life must continue. Others have not just suffered, others have died. I'm also very happy to see all of you masked and safe. And this goes to the principal that how I wish you could inoculate these children, if they agree, before they disperse. And the doctors can confirm that it works," he said. He said the school calendar will proceed since the pandemic is here to stay adding that taking a vaccine is a precautionary measure that must be embraced.
