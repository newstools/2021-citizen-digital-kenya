 The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has warned those living around the Witeithie area of Juja county to be wary of a man-eating pack of hyenas prowling the area.  The warning comes just a day after a 29-year-old man was mauled to death by a pack of at least 20 hyenas on his way home from Komu quarry.  According to a police report, his companion escaped death by the skin of his teeth after they were attacked by the marauding animals.  A multi-agency team comprising officers from the National Police Service (NPS), the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and other local law enforcement agencies have been deployed to contain the menace.
