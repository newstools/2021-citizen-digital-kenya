 Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Chairman Wafula Chebukati has confirmed that ten political parties have failed to meet compliance rules set by the electoral body after submitting afresh their nomination rules. The IEBC boss said on Monday, a total of 72 out of 82 parties which had made submissions in November, resubmitted their rules and met the threshold. "A total of 82 Political Parties resubmitted revised nomination rules and IEBC Kenya has completed a second review of their nomination rules. Only 72 were found to be compliant and will be issued with Compliance Certificates as guided by provisions of Section 27 of the Elections Act," said Chebukati during a consultative forum with the Political Parties Liaison Committee (PPLC). He futher said the 10 parties would be advised on the way forward. "The Commission will contact the 10 Political Parties that did not comply with the nomination rules to advise on the way forward," Chebukati said. The forum was held on basis of mapping out the 2022 General Election preparedness, nomination rules, and proposed electoral legal reforms. IEBC released the new party nomination guidelines on October 15 and rejected the lists that did not comply with the Constitution on November 11 forcing the parties to go back to the drawing board.  The electoral agency, as from last week, started reviewing nomination regulations and will start issuing certificates to political parties that are compliant this week. Political parties, only for those with certificates, will conduct nominations between January and May 26 next year ahead of the 2022 general elections.
