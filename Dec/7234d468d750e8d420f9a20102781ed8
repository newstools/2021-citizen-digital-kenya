 Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho has sworn to go ahead with civil education despite complaints  from Deputy president William Ruto's allies. Speaking on Tuesday in Ndia, Kirinyaga County, Dr Kibicho told off his critics saying Kenyans should be enlightened on how to vote for competent leaders. “My critics should swallow razor blades if they are not happy with what I'm doing," said Kibicho as he vowed to continue with civic education for the benefit of the people of Kirinyaga. MPs who support the Deputy President had been training their guns on Dr Kibicho, accusing him of participating in succession politics instead of focusing on security issues in his docket. The PS also said President Uhuru Kenyatta's government has initiated so many projects in Mount Kenya region and completed them, wooing the residents to follow his political path.  “The President knows very well who are the best leaders and the residents should be ready to follow his political direction if they want to continue enjoying good services,” Kibicho said.
