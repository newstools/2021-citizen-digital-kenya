 Two rival factions from Lavington Methodist church were on Friday involved in a physical succession war that led to the arrest of two armed men. According to reports, one of the groups from the Kilimani-based church led by Rev. Joseph Kanyamu stormed the church’s offices, in the company of 60 congregants, to oust Bishop Joseph Ntomura whose term as the institution’s leader had expired. The guard manning the front desk was forced to raise the alarm to detectives at Kileleshwa Police Station after being overwhelmed by the congregation, after which cops arrived at the scene and controlled the situation. “Upon arrival, the contingent led by the sub-county police commander and the DCIO managed to contain,” the DCI said in a statement. Two of Kanyamu’s associates, Kisiti Matete (46), and Peter Murasi (36) were however found in the possession of glock semi-automatic pistols loaded with 29 rounds of ammunition. They were disarmed and whisked away to Kilimani Police Station where they’re currently being held. The house of worship remains under 24-hour police surveillance until the rift between the two parties is resolved.
