Presidential aspirant Dr.Mukhisa Kituyi now says Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga and COTU boss Francis Atwoli are free to hold rallies in Kenya to some extent. Speaking to media outlets on Thursday, Dr. Kituyi said both Odinga and Atwoli have a democratic right to hold rallies and speak to Kenyans anywhere in the country. However, According to Dr. Kituyi, even with this right to hold rallies, a leader from one community cannot preside over a rally from a different community. Kituyi added that when the Luhya nation wants to hold a meeting, the meeting will be presided over by a Luhya leader. "Raila Odinga na Francis Atwoli, kama wakenya wengine wowote, wana haki ya kuwaita watu popote katika taifa la kenya waongee pamoja, hii ni haki ya ya kidemokrasia ya kizalendo lakini ukiwa  unaita mkutano ya familia yako hauwezi kuita kiongozi wa familia jirani akaja kwa mkutano wa siri wa familia yako...tukitaka familia ya mluyha kuwa na mkutano yao tutaita mkutano ya waluyha." Dr. Kituyi further revealed that on January 1, he will announce his campaign plans adding that he will focus on making sure Kenyans choose a smart leader and not a fast horse. Kituyi further rubbished claims of the presidency being a two-horse race, claiming that horses do not have level-headed thoughts, which is what a great leader should have. "Nina ujumbe kwa taifa la Kenya na nitautoa rasmi tarehe moja lakini kuguzia tu swala la farasi...unajua farasi wana mwenendo lakini hawana mawazo." "Tunazindua mwaka mpya na campaign ambayo inasema Kenyans can choose a smart leader over fast horses," stated Kituyi.
