 The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)
Noordin Haji has said that David Mwendwa, who is the son of Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai, will face the law after he was allegedly involved in a road
accident along Southern By-pass last Thursday where two boda boda operators
died on the spot. DPP Haji’s assurance comes even as the family
of the 28-year-old late Richard Mugendi, one of the riders who passed on,
demanded for justice after they identified his body at City Mortuary. Family members who identified Mugendi’s body
at the morgue on Sunday, three days after he went missing, were shocked to
learn that their kin was among two boda boda operators who died in an accident
involving the IG’s son. According to the family, the late Mugendi, a
father of one, was the sole breadwinner in their family and his death is a big
blow. They have also decried police frustration in
establishing the truth about what transpired leading to the death of their kin. “Hatupeleki ndugu
yetu nyumbani kabla hatujajua polisi wameinvestigate nini na ukweli ni gani…hiyo
ndio tunataka,” said Christopher Otuoma, a relative. The postmortem results showed that the two,
Stephen Musyoka and Richard Mugendi, died as a result of leg and head fractures
from the accident. The results have been forwarded to the office
of the DPP. DPP Haji has assured the two families and the
victim who is still in hospital that justice will be served. “I will check my
desk if it is ready we proceed and prosecute. As we said, justice will be
served to every Kenyan…there is no cover-up, as much as I know. All Kenyans are
equal, including the son of the IG,” said Haji.  Police, who are still investigating the
incident, have already recorded statement from Mwendwa.
