 Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai's son David
Mwendwa is likely to be charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous
driving following an accident that occurred Thursday involving a vehicle he was
driving and two motorcycles. Mwendwa is said to have run over a pedestrian before colliding
with two motorcycle riders, fatally injuring them along Nairobi’s Southern
Bypass. Though lucky to be alive, the pedestrian remains in critical
condition; Mwendwa is alleged to have been intoxicated when the accident
occurred. Mwendwa supposedly fled from the scene alongside two female
passengers on board the Toyota Hilux truck he was driving. Neither the wreckage of the car nor a police report on the
accident was available at Lang’ata Police Station, in whose jurisdiction the
accident happened. This sparked talks of a cover-up. Nairobi County Traffic Commandant Joshua Omukata has however
refuted claims that the police were covering up the accident to exonerate
Mwendwa, saying investigations will be conducted without putting into
consideration the suspect's relatives. “Even if he is the son of the IG, the thing ahead of us is an
accident. We are not investigating the son of the IG we are investigating the
accident. It is not about other personalities,” he said Mwendwa presented himself at Lang’ata Police Station on Friday
evening, a day after the accident took place. Omukata says a medical examination will be conducted to
establish whether he was drunk at the time of the accident.  “At this point, investigations about the accident are at an advanced
stage and in due course, our file will complete once we obtain crucial evidence
regarding the accident before we submit the file to the office of the Director
of Public Prosecutions for advice,” NPS said in an earlier statement.
