 Russian President Vladimir Putin told his US counterpart Joe Biden he
would "really like" to meet for more talks, according to a video clip
released by Russian state TV on Sunday from the leaders' virtual call on
Tuesday. In a short video clip released on
Russia 1, Putin told the US President: "We will definitely meet, I would
really like that." The top State Department official
for Europe will
travel to Russia and Ukraine this
week to discuss Russia's military buildup near the border of Ukraine, less than a week after Biden told Putin in
a call that the US is prepared to impose strong economic measures should Russia invade Ukraine, the State
Department announced on Saturday. Biden and Putin had tasked their
respective teams with following up on their discussions about Ukraine when they
spoke last week. The leaders agreed that it would
be necessary to speak again after the consultations take place. The date and
format of this possible meeting are not yet set, according to the Kremlin. The White House has
not ruled out an in-person meeting between the two presidents but says nothing
is currently planned. In an interview with Russia 1 on
Sunday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin told Biden during their Tuesday
call that Russian troops are deployed on Russian territory and do not threaten
anyone. Peskov said escalating tensions
aims to "further demonize Russia and frame Russia as a potential aggressor."  He said the call between Biden
and Putin was "mutually respectful" and Biden did not frighten
Putin during the call.
