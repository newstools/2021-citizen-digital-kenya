 A Kajiado court has sentenced a man to life in prison
following incidences of robbery with violence against lorry drivers. The accused, Simon Muia Katuu, was presented
before Loitoktok Principal Magistrate Judicaster Thuku on Tuesday. According to the Directorate of Criminal
Investigations (DCI ), Katuu was the mastermind behind a gang that
abducted lorry drivers, roughed them up, robbed them, before driving off with their
vehicles. The court heard that in one of the instances on
March 29, 2020, the accused masquerading as a genuine maize trader approached a
lorry driver at Taj Mall in Embakasi and hired him to ferry maize from
Loitoktok to Marikiti market in Nairobi. He led the driver to a shamba where he
purportedly had the maize to be loaded. On stopping the lorry, his accomplices
ambushed the driver out of thin air and beat him up senseless, leaving him with
serious injuries. A year later on April 5, 2021, he conducted a
similar crime but this time was captured on camera after falling asleep on the
lorry and the driver, after later being beaten up, reported the case at
Loitoktok Police Station. Katuu’s final attempted robbery saw him being
nabbed at Emali in Makueni County by DCI detectives who had been trailing his
criminal escapades. He was first arraigned on April 23 this year
before his sentencing on Tuesday.  In his ruling, Magistrate Thuku found the
accused guilty of robbery with violence contrary to section 296 (2) of the
penal code and sentenced him to life imprisonment.
