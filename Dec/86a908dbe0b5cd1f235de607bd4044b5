 A
rogue police officer who went into hiding after murdering his superior in cold
blood was on Sunday evening arrested by detectives at a bar in Nakuru City. According
to Nakuru County Police Commander Beatrice Kiraguri, the suspect’s phone gave
away the killer cop’s location after being traced by detectives. Kiraguri
says that the suspect will be transferred to Naivasha where he is expected to
show detectives where he stashed his state issued G3 rifle which he used to commit the murder. The
Mai Mahiu-based officer, Corporal Joseph Muthunga, shot and killed his
colleague Sergeant Ayub Polo on Christmas Day after he was allegedly
reprimanded for arriving to work drunk. The pair were at the time stationed at
Kedong Ranch in Naivasha.  Muthunga is
said to have shot Polo five times, killing him immediately, before fleeing the scene. Cases
of police murders have been on the rise in Kenya with the worrying trend’s most
recent example being that of Kabete police officer, Benson Imbatu, who went
on a killing spree earlier in December killing five persons indiscriminately,
before turning the gun on himself.  According
to Interior CS Fred Matiang’i Imbatu possibly suffered a mental break down
citing that his Ministry is trying to de-stigmatize unfounded ideas about
mental health while enhancing counselling and medical help for affected police officers.
