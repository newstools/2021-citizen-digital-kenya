 Robert Wanjala, the father to self-confessed serial killer Masten
Milimo Wanjala, says they have no burial arrangements for his late son who was
lynched by a mob after escaping from police custody in Nairobi.  Speaking to Citizen Digital on Thursday from his home in Mukhweya
village in Bungoma, Mzee Wanjala says he believes his son who confessed to
killing more than 10 minors is still alive should face the law.  Wanjala said the family has not received any communication from the government or police regarding the whereabouts of his son.  He maintains that the last time he saw his son was when Masten
Wanjala had taken detectives to four scenes in  Bungoma where he had
killed and dumped bodies of minors across the county.  “Mtoto bado ako polisi, tunangoja report ya polisi. Wakati
walikuwa na yeye hapa alikuwa na security tight sana, hangefikiwa,” said
Wanjala.  He further stated that he has only heard about his son’s death
from rumors.  “Nilishanga kusikia badaye kuwa mtoto alikufa na mimi mwenyewe
sijadhibitisha kama mzazi,” he said, adding: “Bado tunajua ako mikononi mwa
polisi kwa hivyo apelekwe kortini ahukumiwe kulingana na makosa yake.  Police sources in Bungoma maintain that the body of Wanjala is
still lying at the Bungoma Hospital mortuary.  Masten Wanjala was reportedly beaten to death by a mob at Mukhweya
village on October 15, just days after he escaped from Jogoo Road Police
Station. After escaping from the station, Milimo
is said to have hitched a ride on a cargo trailer and that is how he managed to
travel all the way to Bungoma.  On Friday, October 15, 2021, Milimo was walking around his village
when he came across school-going children who know him and they raised alarm.  They alerted a few people one of them being boda boda rider who
went and reported the matter to the police.   However, by the time the police got to him, he was already dead,
having been lynched by villagers.
