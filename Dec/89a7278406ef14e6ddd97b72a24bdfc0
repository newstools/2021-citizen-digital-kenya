 Eight people were on Thursday trapped while two others escaped with minor injuries after a gold mining shaft collapsed at Abimbo area in Siaya County. According to the site manager David Orido, the artisanal gold miners were on their routine mining expedition when the walls of the shaft crumbled trapping them inside. “The shaft crumbled after the reinforcement on its walls collapsed,” he said. Orido further revealed that the miners were ten at the time of the incident but two managed to find their way out of the shaft leaving behind the eight who are still trapped. While expressing optimism at rescuing the eight, Orido stated, “We have already made arrangements to excavate the soil that is blocking the entrance of the shaft to enable us to rescue our colleagues.” Confirming the incident, Bondo Deputy County Commissioner Richard Karani said that the duo who managed to find their way out of the shaft has since been treated at a local health center and discharged. DCC Karani noted that they are already in touch with the relevant authorities to find a way of safely rescuing the miners. Karani similarly cautioned miners against working in unlicensed mining sites to avert such incidences.
