 Officers from the Serious Crime Unit of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in Makueni are investigating circumstances under which a 28 year-old man was murdered early Monday morning after a night party. Victor Maingi Musyoka is reported to have left home Sunday in the evening after receiving a call from a friend inviting him for a party at the outskirts of Wote town. His body was discovered in the wee hours of Monday morning dumped at the middle of the road. Makueni Sub-county police commander Timothy Maina confirmed that the body had deep knife cuts, multiple head injuries, and the head had been smashed. He added that it might have been dumped there, noting that the scene seemed to be a secondary scene. Police have taken the body to the morgue as investigations into the events surrounding the party kick off.
