 The Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) has
reduced the rates that mobile service providers pay each other for
cross-network calls by approximately 87 per cent, signaling reduced call rates
for customers. The changes will see mobile termination rates
(MTR) and fixed termination rates (FTR) lower from Ksh.0.99 to Ksh.0.12
effective January 1, 2021. “The revised interconnection is projected to
have a positive outcome for both consumers and operators,” CA Director General Ezra
Chiloba said in a statement on Wednesday. “At the retail level, consumers will now
enjoy access to a variety of services across networks and, at wholesale level,
operators will have more price flexibility when developing innovative and
affordable products,”  The review will be most welcomed by Airtel Kenya,
who in October urged the CA to revise the rates citing that it was favouring
Safaricom since it was enacted in 2015.
