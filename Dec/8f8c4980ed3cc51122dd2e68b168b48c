 Amref Health Africa Group CEO Dr. Githinji
Gitahi has urged Kenyans to remain vigilant in the fight against COVID-19 by
getting vaccinated if they haven’t done so already. According to Dr. Gitahi, Kenya is dangerously
on the verge of experiencing a possible fifth wave of the virus, which was first
recorded in China’s Wuhan province in late 2019. The rising cases of documented new infections
and deaths across the country, the Amref Africa boss says, can attest to this. The discovery of the fast-spreading Omicron
COVID-19 variant, first reported in South Africa in November 2021, is also
diminishing the country’s prospects of weathering out the surge in new cases. “All signs show that Kenya is on the verge of
a fifth wave. Positivity rate and hospilisation cases are going up (hospital
data),” Dr. Gitahi tweeted on Tuesday.  “Chances are you will get infected. Question
is unvaccinated (high risk of hospitalisation) or vaccinated (low risk of
hospitalisation)? Get vaccinated.”
