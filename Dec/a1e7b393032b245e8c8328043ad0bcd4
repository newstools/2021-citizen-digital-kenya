A section of leaders from Baringo County have expressed concerns over continued cases of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in the region with a majority of the cases going unreported.
The leaders observed that there were increasing cases of violence against men meted on them by women, but due to cultural beliefs and traditions, such cases are not reported and hence victims suffer in silence for fear of stigmatization.
