 The Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader
Musalia Mudavadi says that Kenya has hoisted a strong landmark in establishing
successful governance since gaining its independence
in 1963. Mudavadi connoted the magnitude in the strides made since earning
the country's freedom, concurrently stating that there
are still unremitted governance structures that have remained to conflict the
nation's values and principals. “Kenya is definitely a more open
society, we have seen a lot in terms of freedom of expression, and I think that
is a good thing in the context of what it takes for a society to be
vibrant," said Mudavadi, speaking at the sidelines of the Jamhuri Day celebrations on Sunday. “I think we still have challenges and the biggest ones are
poverty, ignorance and disease. These remain major challenges despite the
strides that have been made and also significantly I think
we still have to do a lot in the fight against corruption,"
he added.  Sunday marks
the 57th Jamhuri Day celebrations for Kenya and the last of nine celebrations
President Uhuru Kenyatta, the 4th president of the Kenyan republic, has graced
while in office.
