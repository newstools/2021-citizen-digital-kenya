 Close to 25 homes in North
Kanyamwa and South Kanyabala wards in Homa Bay County were on Saturday night attacked
by unknown people who stabbed over 70 cows, killing eight. The residents protested the
laxity of security in the area and asked the government to heighten security in
the area. One week ago, a similar incident
happened in Wahondo where 31 cows were stabbed to death, leaving 58 with serious
injuries.  The residents are worried about
the spiraling attack on the livestock at the dead of the night.
