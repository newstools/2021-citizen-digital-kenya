 Kenyans
have been known to be procrastinators; we do our things, especially travel, at
the last minute and we arrive fashionably late to celebrations. And,
it appears, even Christmas – a day to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ - is
no different to Kenyans. This
was the case on Friday as, for the better part of the morning, Kenyans took to
the roads in large numbers to try and make it to their village destinations for the
festivities. This
led to a huge traffic snarl-up on various major roads leading out of Nairobi, on
Christmas Eve no less. A
few Kenyans were even seen getting creative with the time they had on their
hands while on the roads, with some getting out of their cars and kickstarting
the celebrations as others even whipped out food they had carried for their respective journeys. A
spot check on the traffic system on various parts of the roads, as compiled by
@Ma3Route from various Twitter users, revealed that snarl-ups at areas such as Uplands,
Blue Post, Mai Mahiu escarpment, Kimende among others.
