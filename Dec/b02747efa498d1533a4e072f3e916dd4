 The Nairobi-Nakuru highway's traffic flow has been disrupted after boda boda drivers took to the streets in protest of a police officer's killing of one of their colleagues. The riders barricaded the Kabete area of the highway on Tuesday morning, in solidarity with two of their colleagues who died in the wee hours of Tuesday after being shot by a police officer who afterwards shot himself dead. In the 1 a.m. incident, a neighbour of the Kabete-based officer heard a gunshot and alerted the nearby Kabete Police Station, according to a police report. When officers arrived at the officer's home, they discovered the wife dead with a gunshot wound to the neck. He then allegedly went on a shooting rampage, killing five others while shooting at anyone in his path. The officer later committed suicide by shooting himself in the neck. Dagoretti OCPD Francis Wahome confirmed the incident, saying one of the victims was a boda boda rider who died while receiving treatment at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Two more people are still in the hospital with gunshot wounds. Police have recovered an AK-47 rifle with four rounds of ammunition and four empty cartridges.
