 At least 15 people, including Lamu Woman Representative Ruweida Obo, have sustained minor injuries after the boat they were traveling in hit a rock in the Mkanda channel in Lamu County. Ms. Obo was accompanied by her co-workers and local chiefs in the Tuesday incident. The group had left Mtangawanda on Pate Island for Amu Island for civic education forums with local chiefs. After reaching a corner into the narrow Mkanda channel, Ms. Obo said, the captain lost control of the boat and it hit a rock. Three chiefs are said to have fallen into the sea along with the mobile devices, documents, cameras and the equipment they were carrying. “We are all fine, just a few minor injuries but we have lost a lot of valuable gadgets and others which have been destroyed by the water,” said Obo. The other 15 have sustained minor injuries and are receiving treatment at various hospitals in Lamu County.
