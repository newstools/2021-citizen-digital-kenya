 A murder suspect who killed his lover and his son has revealed to police officers, where he hid the bodies of the two in the Mogotio area of Baringo County.  The incident comes barely a month after he confessed to having killed and buried the body of  a Nakuru-based businessman.  Just a day after the suspect showed detectives the location where he buried his 24-year-old lover, and his one and a half year old son, officers and family members of the deceased trooped to the crime scene for the exhumation.  Samuel Kariuki, a resident of Mogotio told Citizen TV that the incident had shocked the entire community as the suspect was well known in the area where he worked as a casual labourer.  The remains of his two victims were discovered in two separate shallow graves inside a thicket.  According to the police, the body of the 24-year-old girl was buried just a few meters from where the body of a Nakuru businessman-who was reportedly killed by the suspect- was discovered.
