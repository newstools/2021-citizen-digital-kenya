 The High court has quashed the Law Society of Kenya’s (LSK) resolutions made in the June and September 2021 General Meetings and ruled  that Mercy Wambua is the CEO of LSK. The court, in a ruling on Monday, also kicked out the Caretaker Council appointed at the June meeting, noting that the council was elected two years ago but the general membership  remains, with the exception of Roseline Odede who resigned. Justice Anthony Mrima while delivering a judgement on the three petitions filed before the court noted that the June general meeting was conducted in contravention of the court order that had directed that the matter be taken before arbitration. The court further directed the council to convene a meeting within 21 days. If the council remains dysfunctional and is not able to conduct business, the court has ordered the caucus chair to take over the functions of the council with the chair of the LSK Branch Chairs Caucus.
