 Two people have died after a stone quarry
collapsed at Oyuer village in Rachuonyo North, Homa Bay County, on
Monday night. The two, identified as Tobias Ombija (38),
and George Otieno Nyadiero (42), died on the spot while crushing stones inside
the 10-feet-cave at around 7:30pm. According to Kanyipir Location Chief Israel
Okoth Amadi, the two were finalizing their long day working at the site when,
all of a sudden, loose soil and crushed stones came down on them. Amadi said a villager whose home is located
near the quarry raised alarm. The administrator said locals who responded at
the scene launched a rescue mission and, after several hours of operations, recovered
the two bodies stuck beneath the debris. Mr. Amadi said the stone quarry where the two
died is being operated illegally without approval from the National
Environmental Management Authority (NEMA). He has called on the residents to look for
other alternative sources of livelihood in the area such as farming to avert similar incidents in the future.  The two bodies were moved to Kendu Bay
Adventist Hospital mortuary.
