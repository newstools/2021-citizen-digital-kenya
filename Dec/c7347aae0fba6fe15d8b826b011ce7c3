 The Firearms Licensing Board has ordered businesswoman
Mary Wambui to surrender her firearm by Tuesday, December 15, 2021. According to the firearms authority, Wambui
is illegally in possession of a CZ 75 semi-automatic pistol. “I demand that you produce before me firearm
type CZ75 on December 15, 2021 which will be secured,” board Chairman Charles
Mukindia said. In the demand letter, the firearms regulator
claimed that Wambui’s licence to carry the firearm has since expired. The board came to this realization after
detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) raided a
Nairobi hotel last week to apprehend Wambui over alleged Ksh. 2.2 billion tax
evasion. The police were however not able to reel in
the suspect who bolted leaving behind a handbag holding a number of personal
identification documents, including her expired firearm licence.  “In the process of preparing an inventory, we
came across a firearm licensing certificate issued to you by the Firearms
Licensing board. The said license expired on 17/4/2020. By implication, you are
illegally in possession of the firearm,” added the board.
