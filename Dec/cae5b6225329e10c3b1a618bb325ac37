 Nyeri Catholic Archbishop Anthony Muheria now
says the church is objected to the government’s directive on denying
unvaccinated Kenyans access to public places. The Archbishop said citizens cannot be denied
their rights simply because they are unvaccinated, yet the exercise ought to be
purely voluntary. Muheria said that putting such conditions
where Kenyans will be blocked from accessing all government services if not
vaccinated is akin to blocking the whole nation from the same. He challenged the Ministry of Health to come
up with better plans of ensuring that people will volunteer to go for the jab,
such as involving faith-based organization in the vaccination campaign. This, he said, would present a more efficient
and effective outcome rather than opting for draconian measures. Meanwhile,
the Archbishop has also regretted the perceived slighting of the birth of Jesus
Christ by Christians. He said that
most of those confessing Christianity are pre-occuppied by secular
activities such as obsession to social media sites and TV programs. “We have
denied Christ inside our lives and hearts. Our youth don't know where they are
going because they cannot see the star and their ears have been shut with
material and physical things. Let us look up to the star. The star is christ,
the star is the goodwill of our hearts," said Archbishop Muheria. He added
that some activities Christians indulge in to celebrate birth of Christ, such
as drinking of alcohol, can only be described as pagan.  "Ingawa
tumekosea na roho zetu ziko na chafuchafu, bado Kristo anataka kuja kwenyu
vijana. Christ still wants to come to us. Let us welcome him into our politics,
our societies and our lives so that you may be blessed," he stated.
