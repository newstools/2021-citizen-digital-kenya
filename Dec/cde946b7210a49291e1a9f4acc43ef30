 Ida
Odinga has officially endorsed her husband Raila Odinga to run for the presidency in next year's elections, stating that he is the cure to problems that Kenyans are currently grappling with. Ida noted that Kenya is at the moment plagued by problems such as unemployment, poor healthcare and underutilization of resources in the farming, mining and tourism
sectors among others. The effects of these problems, Ida said, have been felt
most by the youth of Kenya. “These
young people need quality education that will propel them to become responsible
citizens and they also require medical care, so that they can perform their
jobs accordingly,” she said. “So
today, I want to release you to perform and to do what you need to do for the
multitude of people who are here and those watching at home. I know you will
not let them down and to wananchi I release Raila to you today. These are your
people take care of them.” Ida says Raila's passion for the nation and the people of Kenya will
guide him in turning around the country’s fortunes should he emerge victorious
at next year’s polls. Ida was speaking at the Azimio la Umoja convention held in
Kasarani on Friday where Odinga officially declared his 2022 presidential bid.  “For
many years, Raila has believed that Kenya can be a better place than what we
have today and I know he is capable of turning the country’s fortunes around,” Ida
added.
