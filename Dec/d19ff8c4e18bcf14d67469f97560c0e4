 Dubai has indefinitely extended the
suspension of all inbound and transit passenger flights from Kenya starting Sunday,
December 26, 2021. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) city, in a notice seen
by Citizen Digital, also said
passengers travelling from Ethiopia and Tanzania will not be accepted. However, outbound flights from Dubai to the
same countries will remain unaffected by the new extension. “Affected customers do not need to call us
immediately for rebooking. Customers can simply hold on to their Emirates
ticket and when flights resume, get in touch with their travel agent or booking
office to make new travel plans,” read the notice.  “Emirates regrets any inconvenience caused.”
