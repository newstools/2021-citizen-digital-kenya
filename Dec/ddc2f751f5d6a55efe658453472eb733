 Police in Nyandarua County have nabbed one suspect and
impounded bhang with an estimated street value of Ksh.6 million at a private
home in Ol-Kalou. According to Nyandarua Central sub-county Police Commander
Abdilahi Dahir Mohamed, the drugs were on transit from Migori to Mombasa before
they were intercepted by police officers along the Ol Kalou-Njabini road. Mr. Dahir explained that the suspects were ordered to stop but
they drove off. “They later abandoned the vehicle in a private home in
Ol-Kalou town before police were informed by a member of the public,” Dahir
stated. The police boss further noted that the bhang was ferried in a
Toyota Wish and had been stacked in sacks. “One suspect who was apprehended while trying to escape on
foot is currently in custody will be arraigned in court on Monday,” Dahir told
Citizen Digital. He said the bhang shall be handed over to the anti-narcotics
team for further assessment.  The route has been identified to be largely used by drug
peddlers to transit drugs given its easier accessibility into other neighboring
counties.
