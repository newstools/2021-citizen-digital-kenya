 From what they wore to the songs they played, attendees of
the Azimio la Umoja convention were a colorful lot. Orange and blue were the
theme colors of the day, with traders also taking up the opportunity by selling
Raila Odinga branded items. It was all orange along roads leading to the Moi International
Sports Centre, Kasarani. Thika Road was orange. Motorbike riders were dancing on roads, whether or not they
caused traffic snarl-ups was not an issue of concern for the moment, all that
mattered was that there was an important function that deserved a dramatic
entry. Schools buses and matatus were parked outside, a testament
to how far a majority of the people had come from. “Nilianza saa tisa na tume kuja hapa bila kulipwa na mou
nione baba atangaze kama anasimama najua atasimama,” Within the stadium, it was an orange and blue affair. For
many, their garments spoke loudly of what Raila Odinga meant to them. The five stars under the Azimio la Umoja tag were quite symbolic
of the 5th presidential attempt by ODM leader Raila Odinga, an attempt at
becoming the fifth president of Kenya. While everyone who came here appeared to make the most
of it, entrepreneurial Kenyans were not left behind. So was the Ministry of Health that set up a vaccination site outside within the center grounds.  Security officials stood to watch as they sought to protect
vulnerable Kenyans, however, a number of pickpocketing incidents were reported.
