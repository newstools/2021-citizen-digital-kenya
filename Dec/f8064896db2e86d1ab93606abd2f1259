 The Ministry of Health on Saturday announced
that Kenya’s COVID-19 cases rose above the 2000-mark, further confirming 27 sequences
belonging to the newly identified Omicron variant. “I confirm between 23rd November and 7th
December 2021, we have identified 9 lineages circulating in Kenya from a sample
size of 34,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said in a statement. CS Kagwe explained that only the first two
individuals with the Omicron variant had a travel history from South Africa and
Ghana, while the rest had no recent international travel history thus suggesting
ongoing community transmission. While attributing the high resurgence of
cases to the newly identified Omicron variant, the CS urged Kenyans to get
vaccinated and those vaccinated to adhere to the laid out health protocols. The ministry said 2,169 people tested
positive for COVID-19 from a sample size of 9,428 tested in the last 24 hours,
taking the positivity rate to 23 per cent. On Thursday and Friday this week, the
positivity rate was 16.3 per cent and 22.4 per cent respectively. The total confirmed positive cases are

program while 13 were discharged from various health facilities countrywide.
Total recoveries stand at 249,222. No death was recorded in the last 24 hours
