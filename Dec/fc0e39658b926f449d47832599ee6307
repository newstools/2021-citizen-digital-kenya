 The Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) now says that there are no new directives on the size of luggage passengers aboard its trains are allowed to carry. The corporation, in a notice shared on its Twitter account on Tuesday, stated that customers are free to carry luggage of all sizes and weight, contrary to a now-deleted Monday notice which capped the weight at 30 kilograms. “Kenya Railways wishes to clarify that it has not issued any new directive regarding the size and weight of luggage that passengers can bring on board,” reads the notice. “Whereas we encourage passengers to bring along luggage that they can easily and comfortably carry, and which can be loaded on board through the passenger access, we have not put in place any new restrictions regarding the number, size and weight of items a passenger can carry as luggage,” it adds. The earlier notice had not only put restrictions on the weight of luggage but also the dimensions. Passengers’ suitcases and bags were not supposed to exceed 160 centimetres in length or 200 centimetres in height. The notice had further warned that luggage with over 60 centimetres in width was unacceptable on the Madaraka Express trains. “​​We are not denying it,” followed KRC on Tuesday’s notice amid claims of contradiction, “This is a new directive that is superseding the one that was announced earlier.”  pic.twitter.com/9Oyk79hMLI
