 Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has ruled out
postponing the re-opening of schools next week over the current upsurge of COVID-19
cases across the country. Magoha was speaking at the 17th Kenya Primary Schools Heads
Association Annual Delegates Conference in Mombasa on Tuesday. He rubbished claims that the current rise in COVID-19 cases would alter the school calendar, saying that all schools would receive their
school manual after resuming studies next week. “Those who are afraid and are closing schools can open them
when our children have already gone two years ahead,” Magoha said. In regard to COVID-19 cases which have spiked on account of the new Omicron variant, CS Magoha called on stakeholders to work together in fighting the disease. “I don’t know what
else to ask of you rather than to pray for your health,” Magoha stated. At the same time, the CS defended the Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC) urging stakeholders who are
opposed to the education system to embrace it as it is here to stay.   Over 5000 school heads are attending the meeting scheduled
to conclude on Thursday.
