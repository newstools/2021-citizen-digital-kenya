Jubilee Party Secretary General Raphael Tuju has scoffed at Deputy President William Ruto’s political rallying call of a ‘bottoms-up economy’ approach. Speaking on Tuesday at a local musicians fete in Gatanga, Murang’a County, Tuju made a tongue-in-cheek remark wondering whether ‘bottoms-up’ refers to a person’s behind or the economy. “Lakini hii maneno ya bottoms up economy… Labda Peter Kenneth ungetafsiri… What is it is swahili?… (*****) juu?” posed Tuju, causing the audience to burst in laughter.

However, this narrative has in the recent past been at the heart of intense political debate, with those opposed to it terming it a clueless  model. Last Sunday, DP Ruto defended his much touted bottom-up economic model, accusing his critics of misinterpreting the slogan. “Mimi nataka niwaambie mwache kukwama kuangalia wheelbarrow…nyuma ya wheelbarrow kuna economic model inaitwa bottom up ambayo itawezesha mwananchi mwenye hana kazi apate kazi,” said the DP.
