The FKF Cup final showdown that will pit Gor Mahia FC versus AFC Leopards on Sunday has been moved from Utalii Grounds to Nyayo National Stadium. Gor’s chairman Ambrose Rachier told Ramogi FM  they have received communication from Football Kenya Federation (FKF) informing them of the venue change. Derby rivals Gor and Leopards will be battling for their first piece of silverware this season with the winner also earning a ticket to represent Kenya in next season’s CAF Confederations Cup. Fans will not be allowed to attend the clash due to the prevailing COVID-19 regulations that bar spectators from attending sports events. Leopards will be looking to make a comeback at the continental stage after many years in the cold with Gor Mahia attempting to win in order to play at the continental level for the trophy they last lifted in 1987, then known as the Nelson Mandela cup. ”We have received communication from the Federation that the match will now be played at Nyayo National Stadium but without fans due to the Government restrictions on Covid 19 containment measures. I urge our fans to abide,” said Rachier Also Read: Both Gor and Leopards have had mixed results in the recent League matches with Gor losing to Western Stima 2-1 at home after an 8 match unbeaten run.
