The board of the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) has confirmed Alex Gitari as the new Managing Director with his term effective from July 8, 2021. The naming of Gitari as the authority’s substantive MD ends a long winding recruitment process which has extended to nearly three years. Gitari has been serving as KAA’s interim Managing Director for nearly 23 months following the rushed and unprecedented exit of Johnny Andersen in August of 2019. While the board of KAA has not delved into the details of the delayed recruitment process, the agency re-started the drive in May this year, 20 months on after first calling for applications. The KAA Managing Director post fell vacant on August 30, 2019 as Mr Andersen ended his term early citing personal reasons. His unprecedented exit was however on the backdrop of a fall out from plans to launch a joint venture between the airports’ agency and national carrier Kenya Airways (KQ) which also saw the then KQ CEO Sebastian Mikosz quit.

Gitari has earned a three-year term in office which will see him at the helm of KAA to at least July 2024.
