A 27-year-old woman in Machakos County was on Monday arraigned in court for allegedly poisoning her two children aged 6 and 5, killing one of them. Mary Nduku, a mother of three, reportedly committed the act after she was confronted by her parents who demanded that she ends an ‘incest’ relationship with her uncle. Nduku is said to have been in a sexual relationship with her 27-year-old uncle Dominic Mbithi despite her parents’ warnings. Nduku reportedly went wild on Saturday and poisoned her two kids after her mother Teresia Mwikya insisted that the relationship ends. The children were rushed to the Machakos Level 5 Hospital where the last-born died on arrival while the first-born is still admitted and receiving treatment. Nduku was arraigned at the Machakos Law Courts where investigating officers requested for more time to conclude their probe.

The Machakos Children’s Department alongside officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) rescued another one-year-old boy said to have been sired by Mbithi and Nduku. Mbithi escaped the police dragnet and a manhunt has since been launched to trace his whereabouts.
