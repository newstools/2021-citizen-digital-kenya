Kenya Rugby 15’s head coach Paul Odera has refuted earlier news that he has resigned. This comes a day after the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) issued a statement of his resignation. The development leaves the rugby fraternity in dilemma on the matter, with KRU silent about Odera’s response. “I won’t lie to you, I have not done any letter of resignation and I won’t lie to you as a person of the press.  Doing that and you report the same would mean you’re writing untrue stories, so I have not resigned as the Simbas coach,” said Odera. Odera has also dismissed claims that he he is joining Kenya Cup side Impala Saracens. “I’m going to coach Impala – no way, this is news to me,” he added.
