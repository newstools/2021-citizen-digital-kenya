AFC Leopards striker Elvis Rupia says he is not worried about his goal-scoring mini drought in the FKF Premier League, saying it is only a matter of time before he starts hitting the back of the net again. Rupia has gone four games without a goal, last scoring against  Wazito FC last month in their 2-1 win and his loss of scoring touch has coincided with a drop in form for Leopards. Leopards have now fallen 12 points behind the title race and on Wednesday the club’s head coach Patrick Aussems conceded they are no longer able to catch up with Tusker FC who lead with 55 points. “I believe I still have what it takes to get to Eric (Kapaito) who has being in great form recently. As a team we have struggled in recent matches and that is something we have to improve on if we have to finish is a better position,” Rupia said. The former Wazito FC player is eight  goals behind his rival Kapaito in the race for the golden boot, with the Kariobangi Sharks goal machine having scored seven goals in his last five games to take his league tally for the season to 22. “We still have a good number of matches to go I hope to stay fit so that I can help my team,” Rupia added.
