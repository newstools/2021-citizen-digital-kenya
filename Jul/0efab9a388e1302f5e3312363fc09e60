Leading telecoms operator Safaricom has adjusted the pricing of its products and services to reflect recent change to the taxation of telephone and internet data services. The changes which become effective on Wednesday will affect all out-of-bundle voice calls, data and SMS as well as integrated plans. Similarly, the changes will impact the pricing of roaming, international calls and SMS along with the cost of fiber to the home (FTTH) and fiber to the business (FTTB) plans. The pricing of all personal postpaid products and services has also been revised. The disclosure by Safaricom follows in the footsteps of its peer Airtel which announced an increase in its headline voice tariff to Ksh.2.78 per minute on Friday last week. Safaricom’s consumer data bundle prices will nevertheless remain unchanged. Also Read: Voice calls by the operator will now be priced at Ksh.4.87 per minute in peak hours and Ksh.2.50 per minute in off peak hours from a lower Ksh.3.50 and Ksh.1.80 respectively. The effective rate for sending a single short message will meanwhile stand at Ksh.1.20 from 87 cents. The cost of browsing using airtime (without bundles) will meanwhile spike at a similar rate of change to voice calls. On the FTTH front, the lowest bandwidth offer of 8 megabytes per second will now cost Ksh.2,999 while the premium (diamond package) 100 Mbps will cost Ksh.12,499. On the same note, Telkom Kenya has revised its headline cost on voice to Ksh.2.78 while the cost of sending an SMS will be Ksh.1.15. Mobile data (non-bundle) will meanwhile cost Ksh.4.50 per MB while voice and data bundle prices will not be affected.
