Bandari FC team manager Albert Ogari has said that their victory against Posta Rangers last weekend will boost his team’s morale ahead of their Friday encounter against Nzoia Sugar in Nakuru. The Mombasa based side has been inconsistent since the league resumption but Ogari is optimistic that the same squad which featured in the last match will be given first priority, with the hope of getting the same results when they confront the sugar millers. “We arrived in Nairobi safely and ready to prepare for our Friday match where we hope to extend our winning streak,” said Ogari. “Hopefully we will be naming the unchanged squad who won our last match as all players are in good condition”, he added. Ugandan William Wadri scored their lone goal in Mbaraki on Sunday when they outshined Posta Rangers. On his side the head coach Andre Casa Mbungo said that they only have one mission which is to win their remaining six matches as most teams are dropping crucial points.
