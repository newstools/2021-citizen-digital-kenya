Loss of concentration in the last half of the league campaign has affected Bandari FC in the recent matches, coach Andre Casa Mbungo says. Bandari dominated the first half of their game against AFC Leopards before conceding two second-half goals making them winless in their last three games. “We have develop a habit of losing concentration in the early minutes of the second stanza which we must cut off,” said Casa Mbungo. Bandari’s last three games against Gor Mahia, Nairobi City Stars and AFC Leopards all ended in a barren draw in the first half and scores changed in the second half except versus Gor Mahia where it ended 0-0. The Rwandan tactician says they will also train more on set pieces as they have also conceded two goals in the last two matches against AFC Leopards and Nairobi City Stars. “Our keeper has conceded from free-kicks which we need also to highlight so as to avoid more embarrassment.” Also Read: The Dockers will play their match in hand tomorrow against Vihiga United at Nakuru ASK Grounds before visiting Bidco over the weekend at Thika Municipal Stadium.
