Kenya received some 410,000 doses of Astrazeneca vaccines donated by the UK government on Saturday. The donations were made public during President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visit to the United Kingdom this week. The vaccines arrived aboard an Emirates A6-EPM aircraft and were received by Chief Administrative Secretary Dr Mercy Mwangangi, among other Health Ministry officials. CAS for health Dr. Mwangangi stated that the doses arrived at an ideal time, as Kenya is engaged in a vigorous campaign to vaccinate more people. At the same time, she expressed concern about the rising number of cases in the country, claiming that hospitals in the country, particularly in Nairobi, are overburdened. “Nairobi continues to record high numbers, we need to more as residents. Our medical facilitaties especially in here in Nairobi are overstretched particularly for those seeking critical care,” Dr Mwangangi said.

The remaining half of the doses donated through the COVAX facility are expected to arrive in the country within the next few days. Kenya had vaccinated close to 1.7 million Kenyans by end of July and has an ambitious plan to vaccinate at least 10 million people by end of the year. During an interview with Sky News on Friday, President Uhuru Kenyatta urged foreign governments to sell, or at the very least offer, intellectual property rights to African nations in order to assist them in vaccinating their citizens. According to the President, vaccine nationalism has demonstrated how unequal the world is. He also cautioned that no one will be completely safe unless the African population is also immunized.
