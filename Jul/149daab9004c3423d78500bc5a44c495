Kenya national basketball women’s team head coach George Mayienga has hailed his players for qualifying for the 2021 FIBA Women’s Afrobasket Championship set for Cameroon in September. Despite going to the qualifiers in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic which largely disrupted the sport in the country, Lionesses overcame African giants Egypt 99-83 in the final at the Kigali Arena, Rwanda to clinch the only ticket from the zone. ““It was a big challenge bearing in mind how to what extent Covid-19 pandemic affected our leagues locally. We were however positive and did our best to achieve what we should have done in normal circumstances,” he said Mayienga has revealed that during the final on Saturday, he only had eight players available with the rest injured. The girls were upbeat, I had injuries which most people didn’t realise. I only played eight players in the final but God gave us the victory and I’m proud because it was a good challenge,” Mayienga added. Mayienga had to without some key players he would have wished, held back home for various reasons.
