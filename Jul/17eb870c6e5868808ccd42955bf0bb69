Britain’s two-time defending champion Andy Murray has withdrawn from the men’s singles at the Tokyo Olympics with a minor thigh strain. The Scot, who won his opening men’s double match with Joe Salisbury on Saturday, had been due to face Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime on day two. The 34-year-old will still compete in the doubles but was advised not to compete in both events in Japan. He has been replaced in the singles draw by Australian Max Purcell. “I am really disappointed at having to withdraw but the medical staff have advised me against playing in both events,” a statement from Murray read. “I have made the difficult decision to withdraw from the singles and focus on playing doubles with Joe.” Also Read: Liam Broady, the sole Briton remaining in the singles after Murray’s withdrawal and Heather Watson’s first-round defeat, advanced to the second round on Sunday.
