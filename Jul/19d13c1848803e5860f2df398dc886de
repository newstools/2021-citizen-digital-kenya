Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has signed a new deal to stay at Old Trafford until at least 2024, with an option for an extra year, the Premier League club said on Saturday. Norwegian Solskjaer, 48, led United to a second-place finish in the league last season. “Everyone knows the feeling I have for this club, and I am delighted to have signed this new contract,” said Solskjaer, who made more than 200 appearances for United as a forward. “It is an exciting time for Manchester United, we have built a squad with a good balance of youth and experienced players that are hungry for success.” Solskjaer returned to United as caretaker manager in December 2018 from Molde, replacing the sacked Jose Mourinho for the rest of the season. In March 2019, United appointed him on a permanent basis on a three-year contract after he guided them to 14 wins in 19 matches in all competitions as interim boss, with the club finishing the season in sixth place.
