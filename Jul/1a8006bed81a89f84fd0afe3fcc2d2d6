ODM leader Raila Odinga has called on the National Police Service and Judiciary to address the rising cases of child abductions and murders. In a statement issued on Monday, Mr. Odinga noted that in the recent past, there has been a high number of deaths involving children as well as increased cases of gender-based violence. “Children are being plucked from their playgrounds, picked on the way to or from school and places of worship and from the balconies and doorsteps of their parents’ houses and slaughtered by adults. Girls and women are being killed in cold blood by supposed lovers, husbands and even parents.
This turn of events is completely unacceptable,” said the ODM leader. “I want to call upon the National Police Service to assure Kenyans that it is up to the task of protecting particularly children, girls and women. Police must assure Kenyans that an individual will not pluck and kill two, four or five children or girls before the ring is detected and crushed.” He urged the Judiciary to assure Kenyans that justice will be administered swiftly and fairly especially in matters where lives have been lost. “Justice is taking too long to come if it ever does for the victims. The delays only prolong the pain and make beasts bolder. Now more than ever, this country needs assurance from these two public institutions that are critical to ending the madness,” added the former premier.
