A Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) officer accused of pushing his girlfriend off the balcony of his fourth floor apartment in Ngumba area of Nairobi was on Sunday detained by colleagues at the DCI headquarters and handed over to authorities at Kasarani Police Station. In a statement recorded to detectives, Police Constable Kevin Amwayi is however reported to have denied pushing Jackline Muthoni off the balcony, claiming she jumped off. Muthoni’s family denies knowledge of the officer saying he was not a boyfriend to their kin and that they had just met on Thursday. Amwayi is set to face murder charges in the case that has since been taken over by the homicide department of the DCI. An autopsy on the body of Muthoni is expected to be conducted Monday.
