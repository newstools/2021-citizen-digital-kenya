Bosnian tactician Sanjin Alagic has left his role as Nairobi City Stars head coach after two years at the FKF Premier League club following the expiry of his contract with the Nairobi-based side. His assistant John Amboko will take over the reins as head coach. The Bosnian tactician joined City Stars in July 2019 for a season, initially, and returned to lead the team in their first season in the top flight following promotion after winning the 2019/2020 National Super League (NSL). Alagic’s contract lapsed at the close of June 2021, but he chose to handle three more games against Wazito, Ulinzi Stars and champions Gor Mahia on Saturday as he finalized his transition. “I’m writing this to inform all of our fans that after 2 wonderful years with Nairobi City Stars, it is time for me to go home. I am hugely proud that I have been here for so long, when most coaches tend to change every 6 months. “I wanted to thank you all from the bottom of my heart, for your support. The past two years have been amazing, and amongst the most intense in my career,” Alagic said here. His exit comes with seven more games to conclude the current 2020/21 season that, had the season not been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, could have wrapped by the time his contract ended in June.

In confirming Alagic’s departure, Simba wa Nairobi owner and chairperson Jonathan Jackson said; “I very much thank Alagic for his passion and dedication in his professional approach to managing a team from the bottom of the super league to one of the top teams in the Premier league…I wish him great further success in the future building and managing winning teams.” Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
