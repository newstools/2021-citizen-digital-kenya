At least three rockets landed Tuesday in the Afghan capital ahead of a speech by President Ashraf Ghani marking the start of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, the interior ministry said. The rockets, fired about 8 a.m., were heard across the heavily fortified Green Zone that houses the presidential palace and several embassies, including the U.S. Embassy. “Today the enemies of Afghanistan launched rocket attacks in different parts of Kabul city,” said interior ministry spokesman Mirwais Stanikzai. “All the rockets hit three different parts. Based on our initial information, we have no casualties. Our team is investigating,” Stanikzai added. Minutes after the attack, Ghani began an address to the nation in the presence of some of his top officials. Rockets have been aimed at the palace several times in the past, the last being in December.
