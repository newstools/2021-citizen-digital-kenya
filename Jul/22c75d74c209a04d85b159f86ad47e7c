The Football Kenya Federation (FKF) CEO Barry Otieno has assured that the 2020/2021 FKF Premier League season will be completed, as earlier planned, unless the government reintroduces Covid-19 restrictions. Last week, Tusker FC topped the league standings by the set deadline of June 30 on 47 points, one above KCB and consequently secured the ticket to represent the country in next season’s CAF Champions league, their first time in five years. However, Barry said the federation was keen to ensure the league is played until the winner is crowned on August 26, in order to maintain the integrity of the competition. “The league will go on as planned until the end of the season and Tusker getting the Champions League ticket even before the end of the season is something we couldn’t stop since it was above FKF. “We’re determined to end the season just as per the calendar unless the government introduces back restrictions before end of the season,”said Barry. Last year Gor Mahia were declared champions for a record extending 19th time after the federation invoked Rule 2.6.1.2 of the rules and regulations governing the game to call off the season under force majeure.

Gor Mahia who defeated their arch-rivals AFC Leopards via a post-match shootouts to win the FKF Cup thus booking the CAF Confederation ticket on Sunday, are lying fourth on the table with 39 points, eight adrift of the leaders.
