Ambilikile Mwasapile, alias Babu wa Loliondo, the infamous, retired Lutheran country pastor, has died. According to a family member Eric Nambolo, Babu died on Friday afternoon at about 4pm while being rushed to hospital. Nambolo says Babu has been unwell for two weeks. Babu captured the imagination of the whole world more than 10 years ago with his concoction that made millions of people from all over East Africa troop to the remote village of Samunge in Tanzania in search of what was described as a miracle cure for practically all diseases. Loliondo township became a household name in Kenya and the whole region thanks to the so-called magical cure administered by the retired church minister. Between 2010 and 2012 ‘Babu wa Loliondo’ had already administered the single cup dose to more than 6 million people but questions began to arise when some of those he supposedly cured died or became severely ill. In 2019, Citizen TV revisited the bizarre story that took East Africa by storm by speaking to some of the people who made the visit and lived to tell the horror tales, and those who only have graves to show for the arduous journey that ended in grief. Citizen TV also made a journey to Samunge village, to speak to the 87-year-old retired cleric. Babu, said he had no regrets for what he insisted was indeed a miracle cure. That was the last interview he gave to a Kenyan TV station. Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
