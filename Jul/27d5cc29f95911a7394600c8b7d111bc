Kenya Lionesses went down 10-0 to Madagascar in Nairobi as the visitors clinched the Rugby Africa Women’s Cup. Madagascar scored a try in each half for the victory to complete a 37-15 victory after Kenya had lost the opening leg 7-15. Madagascar scrum half Zaya Fanantenana was the first to go down the try box with a superb try having sidestepped the Kenyan backline before wheeling away to score. With the centre referee indicating half time the Mitch Ocholla led team had to work on their handling errors, with loosing the ball being a thorn in the flesh for the home team. Soon after the break Kenya would continue from where they left as they tried to break the Madagascar defence. Kenya’s persistence forced Madagascar flanker  Tikosoa Raholinina to be thrown to the sin bid for a dangerous tackle on a Lionesses player. However the Lionesses failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage.
