The burial of corporal Caroline Chemutai Kangogo that was to take place on Saturday was postponed to a later date. This despite all burial plans having been finalized  at their home in Nyawa village, Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet County. The delay is attributed to the absence of a government pathologist at the Iten County Referral Hospital where the post-mortem on the body of  Kangogo was scheduled for Friday but did not happen, leaving the family in a state of confusion. An autopsy is likely to be conducted on Tuesday, July 27 and the burial set to take place thereafter. The death of Kangogo brought to an end a 10-day search for the 34-year-old policewoman accused of double homicide. While police said she committed suicide, many have cast doubts on the theory presented by the police.
