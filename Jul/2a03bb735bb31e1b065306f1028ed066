Financial woes at Gor Mahia FC have backed them to a corner and the club’s chairman Ambrose Rachier has stepped up calls for fans and well-wishers to throw more support on the 2-million-dollar funds drive they initiated. Through the initiative, the club hopes fans and well-wishers can contribute at least Sh100 daily with Rachier saying in a press statement that their finances are in a ‘worrying state’. The situation has pushed head coach Carlos Vaz Pinto out of Gor as well as star midfielder Kenneth Muguna and defender Charles Momanyi has also requested to be released. “It has made it impossible for the club to operate optimally even precipitating a delay in the realization of the much desired investments in infrastructure including the club bus, the stadium just to mention but a few’’ read part of the statement. Those worries can be aggravated if the Continental Federation of Football (CAF) decides to bar Gor from competing at the Confederation Cup having warned they could be barred over compliance issues. For Gor, the competition could be a welcome source of extra revenue but first they must comply by settling debt cases with players who are owed by the Kenyan champions.

Thus the 2Million Dollar initiative by the fans through the Executive Committee, whose aim is to address the challenge is indeed a welcome move,’’ Rachier added. The chairman had earlier promised to be updating the public on the progress of the initiative weekly and assured the public of transparency of the program to be steered by club Secretary-General Sam Ocholla. Rachier had also indicated that they could be forced to lease part of its shares in order to shore up their revenues.
