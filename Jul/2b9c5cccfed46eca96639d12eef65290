Kenya sevens rugby team, Shujaa saw their hopes of a podium finish go up in smoke after a 12-7 loss to Ireland in their last group game at the 2020 Olympics Tuesday morning. Prior to the loss against Ireland, Shujaa had earlier lost 19-14 to the USA and 14-5 to South Africa to finish bottom of Pool C. This was first appearance for Ireland at the Olympics, but were unfortunate for not qualifying for the quarters after Kenya lost 14-5 to South Africa in their second game of the day. However that did not deter the Irishmen from putting up a show against a resilient but unlucky Shujaa side. Hugo Lennox and McNulty Harry were on target for Ireland in the first half with Jordan Conroy adding the extras for a convincing 12-0 lead heading to the intervals. Both teams produced a resilient show in the second half with Kenya proving a tough nut to crack having worked on their defensive errors but no team was able to go past the try line.
