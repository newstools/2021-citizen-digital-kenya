A 20-year-old man is presently being held by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) for allegedly kidnapping and killing two minors. Masten Milimu Wanjala confessed to executing two minors aged 13 and 12 following their disappearance on June 30 and July 7 respectively in Shauri Moyo. Wanjala led the sleuths to the spot where he claimed to have committed the act and disposed off the bodies in Kabete. According to the DCI, the suspect earlier contacted one of the minor’s mother demanding a ransom of Ksh.50,000 to secure his release. He then reportedly contacted the other minor’s father and asked to him send Ksh.30,000 in ransom for his freedom. The suspect is believed to have grabbed the boy on his way to or from Sagaret Primary School in Majengo. The detectives now believe Wanjala could be responsible for the murders of over 10 minors.
