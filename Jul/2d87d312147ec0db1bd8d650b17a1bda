The one-of-a-kind rhino charge exercise at Sabor in Marigat Baringo South Constituency got underway early Saturday morning, with Baringo Senator Gideon Moi officially declaring the event open. However, as the day wore on, one of the speeding cars veered off the road and crashed into a tree that was hoisting a beehive unleashing swarms of angry bees at spectators.

Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis, who was giving a live interview, had to pause in the middle of his message as he scampered for safety.
