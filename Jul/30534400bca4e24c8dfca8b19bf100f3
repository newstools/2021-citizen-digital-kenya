Barcelona have reached an out-of-court agreement with their former player Neymar to end a legal dispute in “amicable fashion”. Brazil forward Neymar, 29, claimed Barca refused to pay him £37.2m in owed loyalty bonuses after his £200m move to Paris St-Germain in 2017. Barca then started legal proceedings to get him to pay back the £8m he received when he signed a new deal in 2016. Last June, a Spanish court ordered Neymar to pay Barca £6.1m. But reports said he had appealed against the decision and launched a new case, which is now void. The La Liga side said in a statement: “FC Barcelona announce that it has ended out of court in amicable fashion the various labour and civil litigation cases that were open with the Brazilian player Neymar.
