The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) has condemned the ongoing ethnic violence in Marsabit County. In a statement issued on Monday, Chairperson Rev. Dr. Samuel Kobia termed the clashes between the Borana, Gabra, and Rendille communities as absurd. NCIC noted that the killings have left over a hundred people dead and displaced thousands of the residents since the beginning of the year. Thousands of livestock have been stolen and several hundred houses torched. “We condole with the bereaved and those who have lost livelihoods in this senseless violence. Learning has been severely affected as schools have been shut down at a time when learners are sitting for their end of the term examinations. This is a sad moment for the people of Marsabit County and especially residents of Saku constituency, the epicenter of the violence,” reads part of the statement. Kobia called on Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to bring to book the perpetrators. He further called on the County, National Government, and humanitarian agencies to support the internally displaced families. Kobia has in the meantime warned individuals to refrain from using inflammatory language, even as he urged residents of Marsabit County, especially those in Saku constituency, to embrace dialogue.

We reiterate that the Commission together with other Government agencies have commenced investigations to bring to book the masterminds of these conflicts. We assure the people of Marsabit and the nation at large that we shall continue to discharge our mandate without fear or favour and will bring all wrongdoers and mongers of hate crimes to book, ” Kobia noted.
