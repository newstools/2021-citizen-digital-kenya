Vskit, a short video sharing platform is slowly but steadily changing the Kenyan content landscape at a time when video platforms are vying for users’ attention. The platform collaborated with Vybez radio in November 2020 and received at least 13.8 million views on videos posted by radio platform users. At the heart of the clamor for views and content, is the sudden realization that radio, unlike what they told us two years ago-is very much alive. According to Vskit, the partnership with Vybez radio exposed the brand to hundreds of thousands of targeted listeners every morning To expand the reach and have viewers click and register on the app, which promises to support local content, the two organized a successful online challenge dubbed the #reggaemvp. The five-week challenge saw users from all over the country compete in a challenge in which the best were chosen by Jah9, a Jamaican reggae sensation who was elected to judge the final week. According to the videos posted on the challenge hashtag #reggaemvp on vskit, 80 percent of them were posted by Vybez radio listeners, which amounted to around 366 videos from users. This was the most external users who had ever taken part in a vskit challenge. During the campaign’s first four weeks, there were an average of seven posts per week and twelve winners. Seven from the initial 12 qualified to compete in the finale and in the very end, 3 people emerged winners in three different categories. The winners were: Jah Didi (Best Sung Category ), Sarafina (Most Popular Category) and Imani (Most Charming Category).
