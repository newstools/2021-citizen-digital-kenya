Kariobangi Sharks head coach William Muluya is hoping his side can build on their morale-boosting win over AFC Leopards when they face Western Stima this weekend in the Kenyan Premier League. Sharks snapped a five-match winless streak to defeat Leopards 1-0 in Thika as they moved into fifth on the standings and Muluya believes that result can help them turn a corner. “It was a huge win for us because we had gone for quite some time without a win in the league. Defeating a big team like AFC Leopards is even better even though they had fielded weak team,” Muluya said. The league top scorer Eric Kapaito converted the winning penalty and his head coach is confident the striker will continue with the momentum in the coming matches in the race to win the golden boot. “Kapaito is goal machine when he is in a good form he can score against any top team he is leading the goal-scoring chart by merit and I hope he stays fit to help the team keep improving and eventually win the golden boot,” Muluya added. The youth full tactician also lamented on the number of injuries in his side sayin they have hampered their ambitions of the title this season.
