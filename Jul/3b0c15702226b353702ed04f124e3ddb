Kenya has joined 24 other countries in signing a joint declaration that seeks to enhance mechanisms for mass production of decent and affordable housing on the continent. The pact known as the Yaounde Declaration was issued at pan-African affordable housing firm Shelter Afrique’s 40th annual general meeting staged in Cameroon at the end of June. Kenya was represented by Transport and Housing Cabinet Secretary James Macharia in the meeting that brought together ministers in charge of housing and urban development in the region. Other countries that adopted the resolution include Algeria, Burundi, Mali, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the DRC, Burkina Faso and Ghana. The declaration is centered on addressing issues of leadership and governance, policies and legislation, coordination, land systems, finance, taxation, capacity building and the adoption of new building technologies. Signatories to the pact have appointed a six-member team headed by Shelter Afrique Head of Legal Services Ms. Houda Boudlali and UN Habitat Regional Advisor Albert Ngomsi.
