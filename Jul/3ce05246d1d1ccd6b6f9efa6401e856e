Impala Saracens head coach Mitch Ocholla has lauded the ‘depth’ in Kenyan rugby clubs’ squads, with his charges filling the void seamlessly despite losing many stars to international assignments. Ocholla, a former Kenya rugby sevens head coach, says many rugby clubs have been deprived of their squad depth thanks to the upcoming assignments for the national teams. However, with Kenya Cup still in action despite losing players to sevens, 15’s and Under-20 national teams, Ocholla believes the country has a massive rugby talent. “Right now many clubs are testing their depth which I think it’s positive because at the moment only one league is being played, the Kenya Cup. No ESS and nationwide action, so this allows young players to get playing time,” said Ocholla. Impala Saracens have won twice and with a single draw since the league resumed last month, with their 25-19 win over Top Fry Nakuru last Saturday in the Kenya Cup eighth round, their latest triumph. After the win, the Nairobi based team climbed from seventh to fourth on the log with 12 points. Also Read: Impala plays varsity side Blaq Blad this weekend at the Impala Grounds.
