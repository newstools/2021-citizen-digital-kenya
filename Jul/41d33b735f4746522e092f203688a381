The 28-year-old Kenyan sprinter Mark Otieno is hoping to shine in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics which kicked off yesterday in Japan. Otieno who is representing Kenya alongside Ferdinand Omanyala in the men’s 100m finals, is confident that he will make his countrymen proud after his last training session in Kurume, Japan. “Since we arrived on Thursday last week, I have been training daily and it has been an enjoyable experience especially because of the weather which is conducive for me. I feel ready for next week’s competition and I hope to put our country on the map early on in the competition,” said Otieno. Last week the sprinter received Sh1 million sponsorship from Safaricom as part of a deal which will give him access to the best quality shoes, support his training needs and cover his logistics to allow him attend other competitions. Otieno clocked 10.05 sec to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics during the national trials held in June at Moi Centre Kasarani and is expected to perform well in the competition. Safaricom also unveiled a Sh20 million sponsorship for the team that is representing Kenya at the Olympics. The sponsorship funds have been used to cater for the team’s ceremonial kits.
