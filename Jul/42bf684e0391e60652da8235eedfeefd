Suspected killer cop Caroline Kangogo died of a single gunshot wound to the head, Chief government pathologist Dr. Johansen Oduor has confirmed. Speaking after conducting the autopsy at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) mortuary in Eldoret, Dr. Oduor said Kangogo had no other injury apart from the bullet wound. The government pathologist said a further probe will be conducted on samples collected from the body to determine if she really died at the scene. Kangogo’s body is set to be transferred back to the Iten County Referral Hospital mortuary. The family will meet on Tuesday evening to make burial arrangements. The burial of corporal Kangogo was initially supposed to take place this past Saturday but was postponed due to the absence of the government pathologist.
