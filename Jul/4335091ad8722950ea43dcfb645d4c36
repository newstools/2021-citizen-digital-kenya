The 2021 World Rally Championship Safari Rally winner Sebastian Ogier has announced he will donate around 2.5 million shillings to support education for the needy and wildlife conservation in Kenya. The Frenchman said in a statement last evening he was giving 10,000 Euros to support the education of children at the Nakuru Children’s Project and an equal amount to protect wildlife at the Olpejeta Conservancy. #SafariRallyKenya was my first time in Africa and I was overwhelmed by the beauty of Kenya, the warm-hearted people and its incredible wildlife. Therefore I’m happy to support @Nakuru_Children and @OlPejeta with a donation 🙏🏼@wrcsafarirally @OfficialWRC pic.twitter.com/TGDUqwkJJu — Sébastien Ogier (@SebOgier) July 13, 2021  The Nakuru Children’s Project is a non-profit making organisation that focusses on relieving poverty and improving education for children in the region.
