FKF Premier League leaders Tusker FC wasted an opportunity to widen the gap on summit of the Kenyan Premier League, after they went down 0-1 to a hard-fighting Nairobi City Stars at Ruaraka Grounds this evening. The Robert Matano coached side would have inched closer to the title had they won as their close challengers KCB lost 0-2 to Posta Rangers in Thika, but Ezekiel Odera’s lone goal made all the difference. City Stars duo of Nicholas Kipkirui and David Agesa threw away double chances each in the first quarter of the encounter heading to half time 0-0. Nairobi City Stars returned from the tunnel the more energised side and it took them only seven minutes to get the opener through Odera. Odera capitalised on a short head back pass from Eric Ambunya and chipped past Emery Mvuyukere for the only goal of the match. Chris Ochieng could have levelled for the league leaders but his close range shot hit the post, after calmly connecting Faraj Odenyi pass inside City Stars’ box.
