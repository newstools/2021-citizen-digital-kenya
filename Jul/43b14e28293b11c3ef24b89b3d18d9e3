Manchester United have confirmed they have agreed a deal in principle to sign England winger Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund in a 10.9-billion-shilling transfer. “Manchester United is delighted to announce it has reached agreement in principle with Borussia Dortmund for the transfer of Jadon Sancho. Sancho emerged as United’s No. 1 transfer target last year but the Old Trafford club could not agree on a fee. The 21-year-old scored 16 goals and made 20 assists in 38 games for Dortmund in all competitions in the 2020-21 season. He helped Dortmund qualify for the Champions League with a third-placed finish in the Bundesliga. Sancho has 20 caps for England since making his debut in 2018, but has hardly featured in the team’s run to the Euro 2020 quarter-finals, playing only six minutes as a substitute in their 1-0 Group D win over Czech Republic.
