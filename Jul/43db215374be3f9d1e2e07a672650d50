Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga has told off those calling him a tribal leader saying he has stood for unity devoid of tribal allegiance. Mr. Odinga relieved his previous association with retired president Mwai Kibaki during the tenure of the Grand Coalition government saying together they developed economic blue print policies that transformed the country. The former premier spoke on Friday in Kieni, Nyeri County, where he attended the burial of Esther Ngonyo, mother of former Thika Mayor Mumbi Ng’aru. Mr. Odinga, who since the handshake has been a welcome guest in the Mt. Kenya region, took on those accusing him of being tribal yet crediting the Grand Coalition government which he served with Kibaki. “Niliangalia Kibaki alikuwa na experience ya kutosha wakati ule…wengine wanasema ati Raila hataki Wakikuyu, wakati nilikuwa nasema Kibaki tosha, sikujua yeye ni Mkikuyu? Nilikuwa nafikiri yeye ni Mjaluo ama Mluhya?” He posed. “Nilikuwa najua yeye ni Mkikuyu…lakini nikasema Wakikuyu ni Wakenya, kama Mkenya mwingine tu.” Also Read: He also rubbished Deputy President William Ruto’s hustler nation politics adding that his support for President Uhuru Kenyatta through the handshake resulted in peace. “Tuko na mpango ya kutosha ya kuboresha maisha katika taifa letu, kuanzia mama mboga mpaka vijana mpaka kila mahali…tunasema comprehensive economic development program, tulete mapinduzi ya kiuchumi, na inawezekana,” he stated. Mr. Odinga also allayed fears that the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) reggae had stopped expressing confidence that the court will rule in their favour. “Mahakama wametupeleka kwa half time, lakini itarudi. Nobody can stop reggae” said the ODM chief.  Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
