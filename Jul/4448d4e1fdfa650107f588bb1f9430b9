On Monday, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) issued the latest Treasury bond prospects covering two re-opened 10 and 20 year bonds and a new 25 year timed issue. The reopened bonds have a shorter tenure of 8.1 and 16.7 years and have an advertised return (coupon rate) of 11.517 and 13.2 per cent. All three bonds are open for investor bids until August 10 during which the 25-year paper will earn its market determined return.
