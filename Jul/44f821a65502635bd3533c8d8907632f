Kenya’s rugby sevens team Shujaa lost their second match on the bounce at the Tokyo Olympics, 14-05 to South Africa on Monday to drop to 11th place playoffs. Collins Injera scored Shujaa’s only try and his second of the today in the seventh minute, fly half Eden Agero missing the conversion. South Africa had scored their tries earlier through Selvyn Davids in the third minute, Robert du Preez converting it with Siviwe Soyizwapi scoring their second try which he converted to make it 14-05 at full time. The score would remain the same to full time as no side managed a try in the second half, with South Africa sealing their quarter finals ticket. Kenya lost narrowly their opening match to USA 19-14, and needed a win against fellow Africans SA to keep their hopes for the quarters. Shujaa who finished 11th in the Rio Summer Games in 2016, will lock horns with Ireland at 5:00am Tuesday morning in their last pool match.
