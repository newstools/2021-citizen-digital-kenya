Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has dared the Wiper Democratic Movement to go ahead and eject him from the party if it finds him no longer useful. Kibwana says the party has written him numerous letters asking for his appearance before a disciplinary committee, including the latest requiring him to do so by July 30, 2021. “Let them (Wiper) do as they wish. I cannot stop them from ejecting me from the party… If I’m no longer useful to the party, I cannot stop them from doing what they want,” said Kibwana. According to the Makueni Governor, accusations by the Kalonzo Musyoka-led party that he supported a different candidate during the Kithuki/Kitise by-election is flimsy because an agreement between Wiper and his former Muungano party called for supporting of the two parties. He says an accusation that he doesn’t pay monthly subscription does not hold as his funding of party activities means it is the party that owes him and not the other way round. The Governor maintains that Wiper can do as it wishes because he cannot risk his ill health travelling to Nairobi while doctors have confined him to rest after a surgery two months ago.
