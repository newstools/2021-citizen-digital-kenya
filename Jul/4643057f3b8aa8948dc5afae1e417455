Strathmore Blades men basketball team head coach Tony Ochieng has blamed his charges for the weekend league match defeat saying they were poor. Blades lost 37-52 to league newcomers Terror of the University of Nairobi. “I was not impressed with the performance, it was a low scoring game, we were not hitting the target. We played good defense but our offense really let us down but it is a learning process from that game,” he said “My players underestimated UON, actually in the second quarter we only scored a basket. Our offense was not good at all,” he added. The team which has been performing well in recent seasons had one of their worst performances scoring just one basket in the second quarter and according to Ochieng his players underrated their opponents. After the weekend outcome Blades have nine points from six matches, winning three and losing three while Terror also have an equal number points from six matches, winning three and losing an equal number.
