National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has formally declared his August 2022 presidential bid. Muturi, who met a section of leaders from Meru, Embu and Tharaka Nithi counties on Saturday, said his vision for a united, orderly, developed and disciplined nation would only be realised if he ascended to the highest office in the land to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. “With your support and your prayers, we will be able to clinch that top seat. We must also put ourselves at the level of any other person with the same dream,” he said. “And I’ve given you my vision, of a country that is ruled through discipline and order, and I want to be the person who does that. And we’re not going to do it when we’re number two or number three, we can only do it when we’re number one.” Speaker Muturi was in May this year crowned as Mt. Kenya region spokesperson in a special ceremony at the Mukurwe Wa Nyagathanga, the Agikuyu people’s Garden of Eden. The ceremony was the culmination of an eight-day series of events that saw Muturi enter a strict, special cultural regimen at his Thigiri residence.
