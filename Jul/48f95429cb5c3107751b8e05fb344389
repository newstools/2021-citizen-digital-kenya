Detectives in Mombasa are investigating the death of three men who were ambushed, attacked, and killed on Wednesday night in Junju village, Kilifi. Coast Regional Commissioner John Elungata confirmed the 8 p.m. incident, stating that the three people, a man, his son, and their farmhand, had traveled to the area to inspect a piece of land. Residents in the area who saw the three reportedly assumed they were kidnappers on the prowl. “Tunaomba wakenya wakuwe na subira, hawa watu waliuawa ni wafanya biashara, mtu na mwananawe na mfanya kazi wao,” Commisioner Elungata said. According to reports, the locals then hacked the three to death before setting fire to their vehicle. So far, three people have been arrested in connection with the murders, and the region commander has warned residents against taking the law into their own hands. “We have arrested three people, locals have been helpful, and we shall get to the bottom of the matter,” he added. The incident comes on the heels of a string of kidnappings in the area, the most recent of which involved the arrest of a man suspected of kidnapping and sexually assaulting young women in the Coast region. Joseph Wamalwa Wafula, 23, was apprehended in Bamburi on Tuesday evening. He is accused of luring young women with promises of jobs in boutiques before kidnapping and sexually assaulting them.
