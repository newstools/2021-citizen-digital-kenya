World 1500m champion Timothy Cheruiyot has been entered in Kenya’s final track and field team for Tokyo Olympics that includes a few more tweaks on the team announced last month. Cheruiyot who was fourth at the Kenyan Olympic trials last month will now join Charles Simotwo and Abel Kipsang who placed first and third respectively at the trials. Cheruiyot, a hot favourite for gold in the mile race in Tokyo, replaces Kamar Etyang who was second in the trials but was omitted after failing to meet anti-doping rule requirements. US-based Moitalel Mpoke (400m hurdles) will also not compete at the Tokyo Games for the same reason as Etyang. Race walkers; Samuel Gathimba (men) and Emily Ngii (women) who were in the initial team have also been dropped having failed to attain World Athletics qualification in their respective events. The duo did not make it after ranking outside the entry requirement of 60 upon the closure of the qualification window on June 29.
