The Dedan Kimathi University of Technology main campus in Nyeri has been closed indefinitely following student riots over fee increment. The Vice Chancellor, Professor Ndirangu Kioni, stated in a memo to all students that the University senate had suspended all in-person lectures following a disruption of learning on Thursday. “All the students should therefore vacate the main campus immediately and not later than 1.00pm today July 15, ” the University VC said. “Further communication will follow” Several videos showed students picketing outside the school, including one in which they blocked the road leading to the campus. Meanwhile, Police officers were on Wednesday forced to lob teargas to disperse University of Nairobi (UoN) students who were demonstrating over fee increment along University Way and Uhuru Highway. The police officers also manned all the entrances of the main campus to bar the learners from getting out and taking to the streets, even as a few of them are said to have been arrested.

The agitated students, through their union, had issued a 48-hour ultimatum to compel the university administration against implementing the fee hike among other restructuring efforts at the institution. UoN Vice Chancellor Prof. Stephen Kiama recently said the recent fee increment will not apply to already admitted students but only to new ones seeking to join the institution henceforth. Prof. Kiama, speaking on Citizen TV on Monday night, sought to defend the fee review saying it was approved a long time ago and the institution is just implementing it.
