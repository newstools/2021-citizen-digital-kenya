The United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund has condemned the kidnapping and murder of children in Nairobi and other parts of the country. UNICEF Representative to Kenya Maniza Zaman called for those responsible to be held to account, while additional measures to protect children are taken. Calling for a societal approach, she added that no child should ever go through the traumatic experience of being a victim of violence and abuse. “UNICEF condemns in the strongest possible terms the kidnapping and killing of children – this is one of the worst crimes imaginable and there can be no excuses for it,” UNICEF Representative to Kenya Maniza Zaman said. “As well as holding the perpetrators to account, we need to redouble our efforts to ensure that children are protected wherever they are – at home, in schools and in public spaces. We need psychosocial support for child victims and their families, and we need to ensure that the public is vigilant and knows how to recognize and report any kind of violence against children.” The 2019 Violence Against Children Survey found that 46 percent of 18 to 24-year-old young women faced at least one type of violence – physical, emotional or sexual – during their childhood, as well as 56 percent of young men in the same age group. This comes as a Nairobi court directed that suspected serial child killer Masten Wanjala, accused of killing 12 children, be detained for 30 days to allow a police probe.
