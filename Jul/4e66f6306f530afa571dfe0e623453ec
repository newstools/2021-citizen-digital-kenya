Football Kenya federation CEO Barry Otieno fears Gor Mahia FC face further trouble if they fail to negotiate a deal with players whose contracts they terminated illegally. Gor were sanctioned by the continental governing body CAF and FIFA for breaching their contractual agreement with Dickson Ambundo who was awarded 1.3 million shillings for illegal termination. Similar sanctions were imposed on AFC Leopards and Wazito FC for breaching their contracts with Vincent Habamahahoro and Augustine Otu respectively. CAF issued a circular stating clubs that have been reported to have breached contractual agreements will not participate in continental championships. “It’s very important for the clubs to reach an agreement with the affected parties in order for them to avoid further sanctions from the football governing bodies. I want to believe the three clubs are very much willing to hold the talks and come to terms with the way they will sort out the payments. “Football has been greatly affected by the coronavirus pandemic and I want to believe that even the governing bodies will understand the current state of financial struggles in the country and around the globe,” Barry said.
