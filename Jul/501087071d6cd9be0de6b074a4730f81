The court has barred the media from publishing information on the proceedings of a case where a woman sued Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka demanding Ksh.25 million in child support. The orders have been issued by Resident Magistrate F. Terer. “That a gag order is hereby issued to any print or electronic mass media in Kenya from accessing, publishing, airing, narrating or commenting the case in any newspaper, journal, weekly magazine and TV or radio show, ” reads the order. The case was coming up for mention and further directions this week, Wednesday. Early this month, Lusaka had told the court that he is the father of the unborn child and did not have any problems with catering for pre-natal clinic bills.
