Detectives have moved the late police corporal Caroline Kangogo’s body to the Iten funeral home, just hours after she was reported to have shot herself inside her parents’ home. Elgeyo Marakwet Police Commander Patrick Lumumba confirmed the incident on Friday afternoon, saying that the late cop did not speak to any of her family members before killing herself. Her body was discovered by her mother while she was going to the bathroom on Friday morning at around 8.a.m No one remembered hearing any gunshots until her body was discovered in the bathroom, seated, with the pistol she allegedly used to execute two of her victims lying near her right hand. Rift Valley Regional Police Commissioner George Natembeya confirmed the shocking conclusion to the story of a killer policewoman who made headlines after killing two men and eluding police dragnets. Detectives believed she had traversed at least six counties since committing the crimes, managing to stay on the loose with a contingent of security agents hot at her tail. Her most recent sightings were in Eldoret on Thursday, and later in Kericho where her phone signal was picked; it is suspected that she used someone else’s phone to call her friend while on a PSV vehicle. Detectives also believe she travelled to Kisii targeting her next victim; a doctor. Her phone signal had also been traced to Iten in Elgeyo Marakwet where she hails from.
