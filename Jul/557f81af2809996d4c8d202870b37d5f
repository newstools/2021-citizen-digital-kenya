Kariobangi Sharks talisman Eric Kapaito believes his goal scoring form can steer the Slum Boys to finish in a strong position in the FKF Premier League standings even as he eyes the Golden Boot. The 2018 Most Valuable Player and golden boot winner currently has 19 goals after 24 rounds, with his latest onslaught against his opponents coming last Saturday when Sharks thumped Posta Rangers 3-0, after he scored from the spot to stretch his lead on top of the scoring charts The high-flying striker, however, says with only one goal shy of his season target, he is hoping his goal scoring run will catapult his side to finish in the top three positions. Elvis Rupia, the closest challenger to the crown is on 14 goals. “My target was to surpass what I did last season and so far I have done that and I believe with team work I will finish as the league’s tops corer. However, I want my goals to help the team finish in a better position and that has always been my main aim then personal target follow,”said Kapaito. Before the recent turnaround, the William Muluyia coached side had gone five matches without a single win before the AFC Leopards’ 1-0 win on June 30 ended the woeful run. Since then, they have drawn against Western Stima and won at Rangers over the weekend and the striker says it was down to believing in the good work they were doing in training.
