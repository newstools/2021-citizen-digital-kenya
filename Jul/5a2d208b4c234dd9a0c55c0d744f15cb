Athletics Kenya (AK) President Jackson Tuwei says the Local Organising Committee is polishing up preparations for the World Under-20 Championships that begin mid next month. With some 55 days to the event, the country Thursday began trials to select its finest competitors for the championship slated for August 17 to 22 at Kasarani even as the preparations hit high gear. The AK boss believes Kenya will deliver a successful championship for the Under-20 that will act as a launch pad for more global events for the country in future. “All that is required is in place and what we’re doing currently is to polish every department to ensure we get everything right before the championship starts. If all goes as it is planned then we will be ready to deliver a successful event,” Tuwei told Citizen Digital. Tuwei added that safety for all the participants has taken centre-stage in the country’s preparations amid the Covid-19 pandemic which has continued to ravage the world. “In every stage of the preparations the safety of all the participants is taking a centre-stage and we will put safety conditions in place which we will also share with all those who will be involved including our visitors to ensure the event is Covid-19 free.
