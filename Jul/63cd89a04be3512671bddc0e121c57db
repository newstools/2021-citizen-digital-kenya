Autopsy results show slain businessman Peter Ndwiga was shot close to his left ear with the bullet exiting his skull through the right side. The cop died from significant brain hemorrhage, according to the autopsy performed on Thursday at the General Kago funeral home in Thika. Ndwiga was shot dead by Corporal Caroline Kangogo, a female police officer said to have gone rogue and killing two people in a day. The officer reportedly shot and killed Police Constable John Ogweno in his car parked within a police station in Nakuru on Monday. She, afterwards, fled with his weapon, a loaded Ceska pistol. Kangogo is then reported to have later that same day emerged in Juja where she, yet again, shot and killed another man in cold blood. The rogue police officer lured her second victim, since identified as 32-year-old Peter Ndwiga Njiru, to Dedamax Hotel in Kimbo at around 4pm.

According to detectives, Kangogo told an attendant working at the hotel that she had gone to buy toothpaste, only for her to escape after committing the crime. Items recovered from the deceased’s trouser pockets included a wallet containing a national identity card and Toyota Probox car keys. The body of the deceased has since been moved to the Thika General Kago Funeral Home awaiting autopsy. “We are cautioning members of the public especially men to be on the lookout for the rogue officer, who is luring men to her trap before executing them in cold blood,” said the DCI. “Let nobody trust her since she is armed and dangerous. Should you spot the suspect who is covering herself in a buibui, do not hesitate to contact us.” Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
