Sharon Otieno was raped in the Kodera forest before being killed. This is according to a testimony on Tuesday by Chief Inspector Lilian Saka, the third witness in the Sharon Otieno murder case who ruled out the possibility of her killers taking her life elsewhere and dumping her body in the thicket where it was discovered. Migori Governor Okoth Obado, his personal assistant Michael Oyamo and Migori County Clerk Casper Obiero, the accused persons in the murder of the 24-year-old pregnant Rongo University student, were present to hear the testimony against them. According to Chief Inspector Saka, a crime scene detective at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) who took to the stands, “the murder occurred at that point (where the body was found) because of the pool of blood at the scene, so the body was not transported.” From her photographic evidence, Saka documented the crime scene, the hotel where Sharon is suspected to have been lured by her kidnappers as well as the spot where the Nation journalist jumped off a moving vehicle to save his life. Governor Obado’s lawyer Kioko Kilukumi sought to absolve his client, with Oyamo’s lawyer Prof. Tom Ojienda taking the detective to task over variation of dates in her report.
