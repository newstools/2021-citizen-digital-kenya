The poor performance by Kenyan teams at the ongoing Tokyo Olympic Games continued on Tuesday after the women’s volleyball team, Malkia Strikers, lost their second match in straight sets against South Korea at the Ariake Arena. Despite losing 3-0, Malkia Strikers ran the South Koreans close in the final set, losing 26-24 after going down 25-14 and 25-22 in the opening two sets respectively. The defeat summed up a poor day for Kenya after the last standing two boxers at the Games Elizabeth Akinyi and Elly Ajowi were eliminated earlier Tuesday. The nine-time African champions were looking to bounce back from their comprehensive loss against hosts Japan on Sunday in the opening pool ‘A’ fixture at the same venue. Malkia Strikers will wait until Thursday to launch yet another attempt at winning their first ever Olympic match when they face 2016 silver medalists and reigning world champions Serbia in their third preliminary tie. Serbia on Tuesday leapfrogged Japan to top Pool A after beating the hosts 25-23 25-16 26-24 with Tijana Boskovic matching Jordan Thompson’s 34 points, the Americans’ 24-year-old opposite hitter, who is competing in her first Games.

Meanwhile, the United States dealt China a second consecutive straight sets defeat in women’s volleyball on Tuesday to leave the defending champions in danger of missing out on the knockout stages. The Americans, bronze medallists at Rio in 2016, have won five Olympic medals in the event but never gold. Their 29-27 25-22 25-21 victory moved them to the top of Pool B without dropping a set, having beaten Argentina in their opener.
