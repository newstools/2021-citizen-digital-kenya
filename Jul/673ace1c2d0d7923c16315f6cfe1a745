The house of renowned Kenyan political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi in Runda early Wednesday went up in flames. Mr. Ngunyi, taking to social networking site Twitter later on, said the house caught flames at around 1:45am. The outspoken political analyst revealed that he had lived in the said house for 27 years. Digital strategist Dennis Itumbi had earlier tweeted notifying the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) about the fire, further telling Mr. Ngunyi that “I can only pray that you suffer the least damage and be safe.” Dear Fire Brigade, please rush and save @MutahiNgunyi Runda House from FIRE. @NMS_Kenya quick action for a guy who supports you if nothing else. Hope the man is safe and family OK. Other than the tweet, I can only pray that you suffer the LEAST damage and be safe! pic.twitter.com/cqGmZSU6ic — Dennis Itumbi, HSC (@OleItumbi) July 13, 2021 Also Read:  My FREN @OleItumbi MY house in Runda for 27 years WENT on FIRE at 1.45 am.
