Foreign retailer Carrefour has stepped up its local expansion drive as it announces two new stores in Kisumu. The retailer owned and operated by Majid Al Futtaim is set to open two new stores at the City’s Market Mega and the United Mall. The pair of stores are expected to open later this month and in August. “Kisumu is the third city we are investing in after Nairobi and Mombasa, and it is part of our larger strategy to increase our footprint in various regions across the country. Our continuous commitment to contribute towards the Kenyan economy is reflected in the increase of job opportunities for local communities where we operate,” said Franck Moreau, the Country Manager of Carrefour Kenya. “As a true testament to uplifting those around us, more than two hundred Kisumu residents will benefit from the opening of the two stores through direct and indirect employment.” The opening of the two stores will raise the total number of Carrefour’s outlets in Kenya to 15, including 11 in Nairobi and two in Mombasa.
