Nairobi City Stars CEO Patrick Korir has denied reports linking former AFC Leopards head coach Ivan Minnaert with a move to the club. Korir in the same breath affirmed the clubs is backing former assistant coach John Amboko, who took over as head coach following the exit of Bosnian Sanjin Alagic on Saturday. “Yes, I have heard the rumours too but that’s not even in our plans, we have club policy which states that in such a case the assistant coach takes over and Alagic handed over the mantle to Amboko who will take the club to the next level. Amboko is a good coach who worked hard under Alagic. He understands the team and he is equal to the task,” the soft spoken CEO told Citizen Digital. Korir has meanwhile revealed that Alagic is taking a three-month sabbatical before deciding his next move. “He had a 2-year Contract with us which ended last Month, he has delivered on his task with the club, we won the NSL and the team is firmly established in the Country’s top tier, he changed everything but as you know Covid-19 has made things difficult everywhere, and for him has not been able to have his family travel to Kenya, nor travel to his Country to see them.
