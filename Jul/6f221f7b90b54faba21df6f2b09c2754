Vihiga Queens head coach Alex Alumira says they are keen to win all their group matches after they were pooled against tough sides in the upcoming CAF Women League Zonal Qualifiers. The three-time Kenyan champions were placed in Group C alongside Rwanda’s Scandinavian, and FAD Club of Djibouti with the tournament set to run from July 17 to August 1 in Nairobi. Speaking to Citizen Digital, Alumira urged his charges to stay focused and positive as they begin their quest to representing the East African region in the Inaugural CAF women’s champions league. “For sure I can’t say teams from Rwanda and Djibouti are easy to beat so we need to train hard and give it our best effort. “As a club we have received so much support from different stakeholders including our sponsors Vihiga County Government, our fans, the federation and other partners. We must repay the faith they have shown us,” Alumira said.
