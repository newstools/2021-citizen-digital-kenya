Gatundu South Member of Parliament Moses Kuria is now a free man after a Nairobi court acquitted him in an assault case. The complainant, Joyce Wanja, withdrew the case saying she had forgiven the legislator. Ms. Wanja previously claimed that the MP assaulted her at the Royal Media Services (RMS) owned Inooro TV studios in 2019. “Nilichapwa na Moses Kuria tarehe nane mwezi wa December tukiwa kwa jumba la Royal Media Services. Nilikuwa nimeitwa show ya Kiririmbi kudiscuss mambo ya BBI,” she said in a video that went viral on social media in January last year. She alleged that Kuria assaulted her because she faulted comments that he made in Kiambu during a fundraiser. “Aliongea maneno ambayo haikuwa inaambatana na event. Tena aliongea ile haifai kuongelewa mbele ya watoto,” she said then. Also Read: Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
