AFC Leopards defeated Bandari FC 2-0 on Friday at the Thika Municipal Stadium as they bounced back from Sunday’s FKF Cup shootout heartache at the hands of arch-rivals Gor Mahia FC. Victory ensured Leopards continued to hang on to their fading FKF Premier League title ambitions as it trimmed Tusker FC’s lead at the summit down to seven points. Leopards, who are bidding to end a two-decade long league title drought, are placed third on the standings with 43 points while KCB FC who play Tusker on Sunday are three points clear in second. Leopards needed to respond following Sunday’s 4-2 penalty shootout loss to Gor and they did so with a solid display in Thika with Robert Mudenyu and Peter Thiong’o finding the goals in the second half. Ezekiel Owade was forced into early action by Atariza Amai before Bandari threatened again through William Wadri whose effort was repelled by Collins Shivachi. The hosts looked much more revitalised in the second half with Harrison Mwendwa’s dribbling causing trouble to the Bandari defence. The goal came from a set-piece when it finally arrived for Leopards with Robert Mudenyu getting on the end of a corner kick to beat goalkeeper Justin Ndikumana. Peter Thiong’o doubled the advantage shortly after coming the bench in place of Eugine Mukangula, finding the back of the net with a powerful header with only 10 minutes remaining. Leopards came into the match with Owade as their only goalkeeper Owade as Benjamin Ochan is yet to renew his contract and John Oyemba was nowhere to be seen until late after kick off. Other first team players missing were Said Tsuma, Clyde Senaji and Hansel Ochieng whose contracts have expired.
