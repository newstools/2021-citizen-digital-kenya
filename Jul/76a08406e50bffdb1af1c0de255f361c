The national women’s volleyball team, Malkia Strikers, on Thursday morning were handed a third successive straight sets defeat by Serbia in the ongoing Tokyo Olympic Games at the Ariake Arena. Malkia Strikers, who are yet to pick a set at the Games, ran the World champions close in the first and third sets but they could not match their experienced opponents, who eased to the victor with sets of 25-21, 25-11 and 25-20. The nine-time African champions were keen to make amends in their third fixture against the 2016 silver medalists to salvage their woeful start after losing their two first matches, against hosts Japan and South Korea in Pool A. The defeat leaves Kenya’s chances of the knockout qualification dependent on other results of the group, and in a must win situation in their two remaining preliminary round fixtures. They are scheduled to take on Dominican Republic on Saturday before winding up the preliminary round against Brazil on Monday.
