Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Secretary General Ambrose Kisoi has hailed women basketball national team ‘Lionesses’ who on Saturday qualified for 2021 FIBA Women’s Afrobasket Championship set for Cameroon in September. Lionesses overcame African giants Egypt 99-83 in the Zone Five Qualifiers final at Kigali Arena, Rwanda to clinch the only ticket from the zone. “We are very happy, we are very impressed and we really congratulate the girls for the good performance. Being a fresh team many people didn’t have faith in them but they proved they can make it,” he said. At the same time, Kisoi has thanked the government for the support accorded to the team which jetted back in the country on Sunday night, noting the gallant girls well taken care of in the tournament. “The facilitation by the government has been very smooth and therefore it made us and also the players to focus on the playing rather than on the logistics so we are really happy about it,” Kisoi added. Kisoi now says by the end of the week they will come up with a formula of training as their focus now shifts immediately to the Cameroon finals.
