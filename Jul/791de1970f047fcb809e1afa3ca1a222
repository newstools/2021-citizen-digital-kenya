Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and the leader of the KANU party has declared his candidacy for President, joining the race to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. He promised to run a strong campaign for the top seat during a thanksgiving ceremony at Ruth Kiptui Girls in Baringo North on Friday. Moi had been challenged by Baringo North Member of Parliament William Cheptumo to stop being lukewarm in his ambitions prior to making the declaration. In  January, Moi was coronated as a Kalenjin kingpin by Talai elders, setting him on a collision course with Deputy Presidenr William Ruto who has declared intent to replace his boss at the helm. His task to ascend to the top will be turning the fortunes of a political party which ruled for 39 years between 1963 and 2002 around. His announcement now pits him against others in the One Kenya Alliance, including Moses Wetangula, Musalia Mudavadi, and Kalonzo Musyoka, who are jostling for the country’s top job.
