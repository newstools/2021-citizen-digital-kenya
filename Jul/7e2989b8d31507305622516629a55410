USA Basketball said it has cancelled the men’s exhibition game against Australia set for Friday amid concerns about a COVID-19 outbreak within the U.S. team. Bradley Beal’s Olympic hopes were ended when USA Basketball announced the Washington Wizards shooting guard will miss the Tokyo Games after entering coronavirus protocols in Las Vegas. Beal tested positive for COVID-19 while team mate Jerami Grant has also been placed under health and safety protocols despite not returning a positive test. The game between the U.S. women’s team and their Australian counterparts will go ahead on Friday as scheduled. The Tokyo Games begin on July 23.
