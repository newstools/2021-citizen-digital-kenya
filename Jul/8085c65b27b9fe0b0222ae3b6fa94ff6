The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed all election petitions filed by Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua against Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. In a ruling delivered in Nairobi, the court determined that all election matters were concluded in the Supreme Court judgement of August 6, 2019. Governor Waiguru, who was the appellant in the matter, had moved to the Supreme Court to challenge the Court of Appeal’s decision to remit Karua’s election petition to the High Court for hearing on merit even after it had been dismissed. Kerugoya High Court Judge Lucy Gitari had earlier dismissed Karua’s petition on the grounds that it lacked merit. In the petition, Justices Philomena Mwilu, Mohammed Ibrahim, Njoki Ndung’u, Smokin Wanjala and Isaac Lenaola agreed with Governor Waiguru that the issues raised by Karua were the same as those raised in petition No. 3 of 2019. The judges found that the issues were fully determined in the same court’s ruling delivered on March 2, 2018, which advised parties to follow the normal appellate mechanism in addressing their grievances.
