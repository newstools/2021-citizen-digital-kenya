Cherotich claimed victory in the 12-lap race when she clocked 15:44.00 as Kenya’s trials for the World Under-20 event entered its second day on Friday at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. “I am happy to have won today’s race and to also make the national team. I am expecting tough competition from other countries but I will do whatever it takes to get a gold medal,” said Cherotich. The Form one student at Tulwet Secondary School said she is also ready to fight for a slot in the 1500m race as she eyes double events in August. “I will do my best tomorrow (Saturday) to try and qualify also in the 1500m. I feel currently I am in a good form,” she said. Jeptoo who led for large spells of the race rued her poor finishing which she vowed to improve on ahead of the global showpiece.
