Bandari FC tactician Andre Casa Mbungo has rued missed chances after a one-all-draw against Nairobi City Stars, in a match staged at Mbaraki grounds, Mombasa, over the weekend. Casa Mbungo said his boys could not utilize the few chances created in the first stanza leading to their opponents striking first, giving them a hard time. Former Coast Stima FC loanee Erick Ombija had put the visitors ahead, early in the second half, before Ugandan William Wadri equalized for the hosts through penalty for his 10th goal of the season. “It was not a hard game but we did not utilize our created chances and that was our problem, and we must be contented with one point despite losing the other two,” charged Mbungo. The Rwandese tactician has been including new faces in his squad and Swaleh Chacha was the beneficiary of the new approach, starting at the expense of Atariza Amai against City Stars, as Abdallah Hassan began on the bench, the third game in a row. Holding midfielder Dennis Magige has also played three full games in a row since starting against Kariobangi Sharks as well as Gor Mahia.

Bandari and City Stars are both tied on 33 points in 6th and 7th position respectively with the dockers having a game in hand. The dockers will now travel for two away matches against AFC Leopards and Bidco respectively as they wait for another away match against Vihiga United to be rescheduled after being postponed, with Kakamega County being among 13 counties barred from hosting sports activities, as measures to contain Covid-19. Vihiga have been using Narok Stadium for their home matches currently, where they  hosted Mathare United last week, losing 2-1.
