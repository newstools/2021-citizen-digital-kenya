The search for a missing GSU officer attached to the GSU headquarters in Ruaraka has now been extended beyond Nairobi and its environs. Police say they are relying on technology to establish the last person the officer spoke to before his phone was switched off. The signal of Joseph Otieno’s phone was last traced to a supermarket in Ruaraka at 11:13 am on July 9, 2021. According to Kasarani OCPD Peter Mwanzo, combing the areas of Nairobi has borne no fruits and now they are casting their nets wide in search of the missing officer. The search in various mortuaries has also not been successful. The abandoned car found in Mwiki Gituamba Farm was recently subjected to forensic analysis for clues as the search for the officer continues. Mr. Otieno, 36, was reported missing by his wife Caroline Odhiambo on July 11 at the Kasarani Police Station.
