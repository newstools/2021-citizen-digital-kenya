Former Meru CEC for Youth and Sports Daniel Kiogora has been freed on a Ksh.1 million bond or a Ksh.500,000 cash bail after pleading not guilty to forgery charges. Kiogora, appearing before Meru Law Courts Chief Magistrate Stella Abuya, was charged on 12 counts revolving around forgery of his academic certificate to acquire the CEC post. The case was set to be mentioned on July 19 and to be heard on September 20 this year. The University of Nairobi (UoN) in May last year disowned the degree Kiogora claimed to have obtained from the institution. Kiogora had, during his vetting, presented academic papers claiming he had graduated from UoN in 2010 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree; Second Class Honours, Upper Division. The papers however drew suspicion in the Meru County Assembly, with Municipality MCA Elias Murega eventually writing to UoN for clarification.
