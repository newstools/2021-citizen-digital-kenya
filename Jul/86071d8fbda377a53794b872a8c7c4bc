The 2019 world 10,000m bronze medalist Rhonex Kipruto has been included in Kenya’s 10,000m team for the Tokyo Olympics. Kipruto replaces the 2015 world 10,000m silver medallist Geoffrey Kamworor who pulled out of the team due to an injury a few days ago. Team Kenya’s General Team Manager Barnaba Korir said Kipruto has officially joined the team after clearance from World Athletics. “We are pleased to announce that Rhonex Kipruto is the latest inclusion to our athletics team for the Tokyo Olympics. He has already reported at Kasarani Stadium where the remaining part of team Kenya are in residential training in a bubble camp. The decision was arrived at after AK sought clearance from the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) on his anti-doping testing status, which I am pleased to say he has been given the green light.” Korir said via his official Facebook page.
