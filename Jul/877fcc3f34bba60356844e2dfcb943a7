Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton heads title rival Max Verstappen’s Red Bull by just 0.088 seconds in final practice at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Hamilton’s team-mate Valtteri Bottas third quickest, 0.229secs off the pace with a lap set slightly earlier in the session, as the stage was set for a gripping qualifying session at 14:00 BST. Unlike Bottas, Hamilton and Verstappen set their fastest times after the session was stopped following a heavy crash for Haas driver Mick Schumacher. The German lost control in Turn 11, the fastest corner on the track, and looks likely to miss qualifying as a result of the damage to his car. Ferrari drivers Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc were fourth and fifth – with Leclerc looking as if he might have more time in his car if he can put clean a lap together – ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris and Red Bull’s Sergio Perez. McLaren’s Daniel Ricciardo, Alpine’s Fernando Alonso and Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll completed the top 10.
