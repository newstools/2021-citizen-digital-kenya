The women’s 1500m is set to produce fireworks at the  2020 Tokyo Olympic Games with two of the finest athletes over the distance set for yet another clash at the grandest stage. Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon will be eyeing to retain the title she won five years ago in Rio while the world champion Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands will be looking to snatch yet another title from Kipyegon. Hassan wrestled the world title from Kipyegon two years ago in Doha, shortly after Kipyegon made her comeback from the maternity break. Kipyegon who has been in resurgent form is also looking to be the second woman to achieve back to back titles at the Olympic Games in 1500m. “For sure, as the defending champion I feel some pressure as I head to Tokyo.  My prayer is to successfully defend the title I won in Rio,” said Kipyegon. The 27-year-old recently edged Hassan after a scintillating performance at the Monaco Diamond League earlier this month, the final outing for the pair before the Tokyo Games.

In Monaco, Kipyegon secured victory in a Kenyan record of 3:51.07 which is also the fourth fastest time in history. “I felt I was strong at Monaco and I am happy I could achieve that time. I feel I am in good shape at the moment and I hope to continue with the same momentum in Tokyo,” said Kipyegon. Kipyegon, the world silver medallist, will be teaming up with the Continental Cup winner Winnie Chebet and the World Under-20 silver medallist Edinah Jebitok in the Kenyan team. Apart from Hassan, European champion Laura Muir is also expected to contend for a podium finish. The women’s 1500m heats will be held on August 2 with semi final and final slated for August 4 and 6 respectively.
