Team Kenya preparations for the Tokyo Olympic Games starting on July 23 entered Phase Two with two teams settling in Kurume City, Japan for a pre-games training camp. Team Kenya travelled in small groups six players maximum to minimize the risk of Covid-19 infection while travelling to Japan. First to arrive was half of the rugby men’s team and half of the women’s volleyball team. They were joined 24 hours later by the other half of both teams.  Volleyball team Malkia Strikers’ coach Paul Bitok says the team has settled in well in Kurume despite the long journey from Nairobi through Doha, Qatar. “We have been received very well in Japan, especially in Kurume City. They are very caring and have given us all we want. The facilities are fantastic, we are really enjoying it. We have even received new balls,” said coach Bitok. He added: “I think it is our time now to train for the next ten days and we hope to have the best training camp here in Kurume City.” Upon arrival, all members of Team Kenya were tested for Covid-19 before proceeding to the hotel where everyone isolated until the next day when they were tested again. All players and officials passed the test with no cases reported in the Kenya team. After the two tests, the team proceeded to Kurume City for the camp.
