Kenya rugby sevens team popularly known as ‘Shujaa’ began their quest for an Olympic gold off to a sluggish note losing narrowly 19-14 to giants USA this morning at the Tokyo Stadium in Japan. Shujaa were trailing 12-07 at halftime after USA scored two tries, converting one against Kenya’s  single try by Collins Injera which was converted by fly half Eden Agero. It was a 07-07 draw in the second half with Jeffrey Oluoch sprinting from the 22 to score for Kenya, with Agero adding the extras but it was not enough to match USA’s pace at full time. Innocent ‘Namcos’ Simiyu charges face fellow Africans South Africa at 1.00 pm (EAT) before taking on Ireland at 5am Tuesday morning. This is the second time Shujaa are making an appearance at the Olympics after a debut show in  2016.
