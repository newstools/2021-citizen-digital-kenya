There will be no relief to monthly electricity bills at the end of July after an upward adjustments to tariffs on Friday by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA). While the fuel cost charge will ease to Ksh.3.30 per unit of power consumed this month, the foreign exchange fluctuation adjustment tariff is set to shot up to Ksh.1.20 per unit from 77 cents in June. The water resource management authority levy is meanwhile set to hit Ksh.1.93 from nearly zero previously. The greater foreign exchange fluctuation tariff stems from a marginal reversal in gains by the local currency and references power purchases paid for in US dollars.
