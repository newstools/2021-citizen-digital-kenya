Newly appointed Nairobi City Stars coach John Amboko is adamant his side will bounce back from a string of poor results capped by Monday’s 2-1 defeat to Bidco United. Amboko faces the Herculean task of replicating the impressive exploits by former City tactician Sanjin Alagic who left a fortnight ago upon expiry of his contract and is yet to lead his charges to victory in his first three attempts. While attributing Monday’s setback to tough luck, Amboko has rallied his midfield troops to up their game after their mistakes proved costly against a clinical Bidco United side. Stars are without their midfield duo of Sven Yidah and Oliver Maloba who are on international duty with the Kenya under 23 team in Ethiopia for the 2021 CECAFA U-23 Challenge Cup. “We lost many passes in the midfield more so in the first half where we failed to coordinate. “Our opponents made the most of it and we need to work on it.” Also Read: In their next match on Friday against league leaders Tusker, the Hope Center-based side will have to make do with the absence of seasoned defender Abdalla Salim “Shittu” who was sent off yesterday, making it even harder for the outfit that is winless in their last three outings. “We will have to find a replacement for him and it’s a big blow to our side given the fact that his contribution is immense to our success so far this season.” His opposite number Anthony “Vieira” Akhulia lauded his side for getting the job done despite being away from home. “It was a tough game for us because we played against each other in the second-tier last season and also we knocked them out of the league cup.” “The win will give the boys believe that they achieve more and I’m happy for what they have done today.” Bidco will take on misfiring Western Stima on Saturday in their quest to climb higher on the log.
