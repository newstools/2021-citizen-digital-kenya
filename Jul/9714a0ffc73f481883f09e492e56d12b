Land investments in Ongata Rongai and Athi River have delivered the highest return in the past year among other regions covering Nairobi and its environs. This is according to statistics from the just published 2021 Nairobi Metropolitan Area (NMA) Land Report by Cytonn Research. Land holdings in the two satellite towns have delivered the highest capital appreciation at 8.9 and 8.7 per cent over the last 12 months. Other regions delivering high returns to holders of land parcels include Ruiru, Kitisuru, Juja, Karen and Embakasi. On average, suburbs in low rise residential areas delivered the highest return on land investments this past year at 4.5 per cent beating the return from both services and unserviced parcels of land in satellite towns.
