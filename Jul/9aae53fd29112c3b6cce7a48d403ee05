The Jubilee Party has expressed dissatisfaction with how the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) managed the Kiambaa by-election where UDA party’s Njuguna Wanjiku was declared the winner. In a statement issued on Monday, the party demanded a recount of the votes, taking issue with the tallying of votes during the mini poll. “…we wish to categorically state that we are dissatisfied with how the IEBC managed the by-election, particularly the tallying process. We demand a recount of the vote and will in the coming days pursue this,” reads the statement. Addressing the media at the party headquarters, Jubilee Secretary General David Murathe claimed they won the Kiambaa Constituency by-election. “We are happy to take the flack and responsibility where we have fallen short of expectations… We think we gave it our best shot and I think we actually won that is the message that you are getting from this group,” said Murathe. UDA’s Njuguna Wanjiku won the hotly contested Kiambaa Parliamentary by-election with 21,773 votes beating Jubilee’s Kariri Njama with 21,263 votes, a difference of 510 votes.

Meanwhile, the Jubilee National Management Committee held a meeting on Monday where it deliberated on “rejuvenating the Party at the grassroot level through public engagements with our dear members.” “Aside from that, we note with concern that there are many fake accounts being used to disseminate misinformation with the aim of creating conflict and crisis in the Party. We are escalating this to ensure that those who are responsible are exposed,” said the party. Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
