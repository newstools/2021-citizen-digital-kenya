Kithimani Law Courts Senior Resident Magistrate Eva Wambugu ordered that they be held at the Matuu police station. They are accused of assisting a group of suspects in a daring robbery at the Matuu Equity Bank in Machakos County. At around 9.10 a.m. on Tuesday, the suspects robbed customers at gunpoint of their cash and an unknown amount of money from the bank. Also Read: The two policemen- constables Patrick Omusebe and Dorothy Opili,who were manning the bank, according to preliminary investigations by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), were also involved in the heist plot and execution. The two cops who are being investigated presented themselves as victims after the gunmen allegedly bruised both of their hands and disarmed them of their AK47 weapons, both of which were loaded with 60 rounds of ammo. The robbery lasted around 20 minutes, and police are concerned that Omusebe, although having many opportunities to flee, did not do so and was caught engaging with the armed criminals terrorizing the bank customers. The investigations, led by Machakos police chief Issa Muhamud and his DCI counterpart Charles Mutua, have concluded that “the attackers were either rogue police officers or ex-officers” because of the way the heist was carried out.
