Kenya will be eyeing her first medal at the Tokyo Olympics when the track and field action gets underway on Friday at the Olympic Stadium. The men’s 10,000m final will be held at 2.30pm with Rodgers Kwemoi, Weldon Langat and Rhonex Kipruto looking to end Kenya’s 53 year-wait for a gold medal at the Olympics. Kennedy Tanui, Kenya’s assistant team manager is hopeful the trio will open Kenya’s medal account at the Tokyo Games tomorrow. “Despite the fact that Kamworor is not in the team because of injury, we got a very suitable replacement that is Rhonex Kipruto who is ranked sixth in the world,” said Tanui. The TM is also optimistic Kwemoi will fly Kenya’s flag in style, running in Japan’s capital where he works and lives. “This is Rodgers Kwemoi’s stadium, this is home for him because he works here in Japan so weather should not be a problem for him and he is ready to give his Tokyo fans a world class race,” said Tanui.
