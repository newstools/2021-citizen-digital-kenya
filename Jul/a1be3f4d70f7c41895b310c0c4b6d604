As the 2022 presidential race begins to take shape, Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka says he is ready to face Deputy President William Ruto in next year’s election. The wiper boss, while speaking in Kitui County, dismissed Ruto’s hustler narrative terming it unrealistic. He exuded confidence that he will floor Ruto in the race to succeed President Kenyatta. “Defeating William Ruto is my number one priority and I have reasons for it… Defeating you we shall,” said Kalonzo. Kalonzo says he is set to kickstart countrywide rallies to popularize his presidential bid. “Yeyote yule anataka kuja kuomba kura ukambani amekaribishwa… Mimi nitaenda Eldoret kwa William Ruto, Siaya, Kisumu… Nitaenda everywhere. That is the nation we want,” added the Wiper leader.
