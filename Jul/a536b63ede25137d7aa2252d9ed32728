National Super League (NSL) side Fortune Sacco have set their sights on finishing second after a series of impressive results saw them go fourth albeit with a game in hand. The Kianyaga stadium-based side has garnered ten out of a possible twelve points in their last four outings thereby marking a complete turnaround from a side whose season seemed to be over after a section of its players staged a go-slow citing poor remuneration earlier this season. Their latest victory against APS Bomet on Saturday saw them displace Shabana to fourth place and club Secretary Julius Kariuki is adamant this is their opportunity to qualify for the top-tier league. “Am glad the way the boys have managed turn around the club’s fortunes after the confusion that we had earlier. “Am convinced we have what it takes to earn direct promotion if we maintain our momentum,” he told Citizen Digital. While lauding the players’ change of attitude, Kariuki is confident their impressive form will inspire them to believe they can challenge for the title with thirteen games remaining. Also Read: He has also urged his charges to maintain focus to stand a better chance of achieving their ambitions for the season. “Focus is very important since a slight disruption can cost us dearly. That is why we always insist that players air their grievances instead of staying quiet something that can affect their productivity.”  Weekend Results MCF 1-0 Shabana Fortune Sacco 1-0 APS Bomet FC Talanta 2-0 Murang’a SEAL Kenya Police 1-1 Nairobi Stima Modern Coast Rangers 4-0 Silibwet Leons Midweek Fixtures Nairobi Stima v Kisumu Hot Stars Kibera Black Stars v MCF Coast Stima v Fortune Sacco Mt Kenya United v Modern Coast Rangers Murang’a Seal v Gusii FC Soy United v Vihiga Bullets Mwatate United V FC Talanta Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
