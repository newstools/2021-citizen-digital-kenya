Forty County Football Associations have called upon the Sports Registrar to cancel the interim registration certificate issued to Football Kenya Federation for violating the Sports Act 2013. Led by Mombasa Chairman Goshi Juma Ali, their plea followed a consultative meeting held in Mombasa over the weekend where they adopted eight resolutions, including formation of a national association to challenge the legitimacy of FKF. “We will invoke the provisions of Article 51 (1) of the Sports Act 2013 to petition the Sports Registrar to cancel the interim registration certificate issued to Football Kenya Federation on May 24, 2018 for the reason that the FKF has violated the Act and other applicable laws,” read part of their press release. This is in their quest to conduct elections and roll-out football activities in their respective counties, despite a stern warning by FKF President Nick Mwendwa to clubs associating with the emerging rival association. “We shall endeavor, working with the Sports Registrar, to have all the Counties that have acquired interim registration to fully comply with the applicable laws by registering clubs and holding elections by October 31, 2021.” The FKF rivals have also adopted a national football structure, comprising of a five-tier men’s football league, a four-tier women’s football league, a two-tier County football structure and a youth structure of three-tiers.

Earlier this year, Bandari FC were directed by the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) to align their youth team with the country’s league structures to keep their place in the FKF competitions, as they were participating in the Mombasa County Football Association league.
