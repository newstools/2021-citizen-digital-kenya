Detectives in Nairobi arrested a five-man gang, foiling a bank robbery attempt at Prime Bank OTC branch on Friday morning. The suspects, Charles Mulo, Fredrick Muderwa, Jesse Muriuki, Gabriel Mungai, and Reuben Njuka, were arrested in the early hours of the morning by a team of officers from DCI and Kamukunji police station as they were about to break into the bank at Angle House along Ukwala lane in downtown Nairobi. “The criminals had booked themselves into guest rooms at the said building, which shares the same wall with the bank,” a police report seen by Citizen Digital says. The suspects had planned to drill into the wall in the middle of the night, according to detectives handling the case. Officers who got to learn of the plan raided the building just as the suspects fled to safety in the building’s ceiling. “Detectives however brought the ceiling down, exposing the five who clung on the roof trusses for dear life,” the police report says. “With the iron sheets above them and the armed sleuths waiting to pounce on them on the ground, the miscreants were left with no other option, other than to surrender into the good hands of our officers.” Three hacksaws, one knotted twisted rope, one metal drill, five metal bars, one metal cutter scissors, and one suitcase were recovered during the operation. The suspects have been placed in lawful custody pending their court appearance. Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
