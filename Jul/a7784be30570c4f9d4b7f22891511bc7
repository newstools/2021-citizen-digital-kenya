The national women’s basketball team lost 106-107 to Egypt in a nail-biting clash at the ongoing FIBA Women’s Afrobasket Zone Five Qualifiers played at the Kigali Arena in Rwanda. The Kenyans led 66-41 at the interval and looked on course for an upset before a second half collapse allowed the Egyptians to claw back and seal their third victory in as many games. Kenya’s Lionesses had won just one match against South Sudan and were keen for another win in order to avoid a tough draw in the semis after they were thrashed 45-77 by Rwanda in their opener. It is projected they will finish third and face Rwanda again in the last four with Egypt set to face South Sudan in the other semis. The hosts Rwanda will be facing South Sudan later Wednesday. The qualifiers, which ends Saturday, will see the four countries battle for the sole ticket reserved for the Zone Five countries in Africa’s biggest tournament set for September in Cameroon.
