Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi hopes to see Kenyan clubs especially Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards be professionalized. Mudavadi, a former Leopards patron, says the Government can provide support to allow football teams in the country to improve their organizational structure and start depending on their own revenues. “Through legislation, we can start professionalizing these great clubs so that they can start depending on themselves as soon as they are stable,” Mudavadi told Radio Citizen. He has added that there is an ongoing push for Leopards and Gor to get title deeds of the land donated to them by the late president Daniel Arap Moi. Through this, these two clubs would be able to have their own training grounds, cut costs and attract more corporate partnerships. “We have been pushing for the clubs to acquire their own title deeds of their land so that they may put up a center which when erected can help generate revenue, have their own training ground and also give them to others to use.

Ingwe and K’Ogalo players often had to go for months without salaries and allowances which has led the playing unit to down their tools in protest. Last month, Gor and Leopards chairmen Ambrose Rachier and Dan Shikanda pleaded with the Government to stop the reintroduction of the 20% excise bill on betting companies. The enactment of the law would mean all clubs under betting firms sponsorship be rendered unable to continue with their operations.
