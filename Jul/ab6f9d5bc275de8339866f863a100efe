Samoa’s national rugby sevens teams are stranded in Dubai after missing out on qualification for the Tokyo Games, a Samoan Olympic official said on Thursday. The Samoa Observer newspaper reported players and staff from the men’s and women’s teams were denied passage on a repatriation flight from Dubai to New Zealand after an “apparent failure” to comply with the Samoan government’s COVID-19 health requirements. “I know they’re stuck in Dubai at the moment,” Samoa’s Olympic President Patrick Fepuleai told Reuters by telephone. Fepuleai said he understood there was a problem with the players’ blood tests but referred further queries to the Samoan rugby federation, who were unavailable for comment. “There is only one repatriation flight a month into Samoa,” the former Samoa international told Reuters. “They have to wait until July 27 for the next one.
