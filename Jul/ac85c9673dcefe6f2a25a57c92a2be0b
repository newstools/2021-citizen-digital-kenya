Coast Stima head coach Hussein Madaga said they will use their win against Kenya Police as a motivation ahead of the Mombasa derby in the National Super League (NSL) match against their rivals Modern Coast Rangers at Mbaraki grounds on Saturday. Stima who had lost in five matches consecutively, defeated title contenders Police FC in Nairobi and Madaga hopes that will be their turning point if they rectify small mistakes. “We have small blunders to correct and I am sure we will emerge victorious in the Mombasa derby,” said Madaga after the police win. At the same time he added that they are working around the clock to make sure they escape relegation after bad form which they experience by lack of sponsors. “We are still hopeful to remain in the league with 12 matches remaining; it is still possible,” explained soft-spoken Madaga. On his side Modern Coast Rangers counterpart Mohammed Mchule said despite a lot of injuries in his squad, they are eyeing nothing but a win as they continue to fight for their place in the second tier league in the country.
