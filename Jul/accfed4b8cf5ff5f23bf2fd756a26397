Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, has been placed under total lockdown for ten days, beginning July 17, as the country fights a devastating third wave that has seen fatalities rise in recent weeks. The measures will lapse on July 26. A total of 607 people have died as a result of the illness, with 74 others in critical condition. President Paul Kagame announced the measures at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, prohibiting non-essential movements in the capital and the districts of Gicumbi, Burera, Musanze, Kamonyi, Nyagatare, Rwamagana, Rubavu, and Rutsiro. Rwanda has 14,553 active coronavirus cases as of Wednesday, with a positive rate of 17.5 percent, the highest since the pandemic began.
