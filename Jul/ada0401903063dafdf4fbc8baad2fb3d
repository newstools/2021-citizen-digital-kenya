Manufacturers from Kenya and Tanzania have staged talks to deliberate on joint trade promotion and market access between the pair of countries. The convention which commences on Wednesday shall run through to Friday and will include government representatives. The Kenyan delegation will be lead by the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) Chairman Mucai Kunyiha who expects the deliberations to lead in increased competitiveness of products and services on offer from both countries. “Kenya and Tanzania have the capability and capacity to add value to the wide array of resources that both countries have for export markets. However, achieving this is hindered every time the business community encounters impediments to trade, consequently, impacting on the benefits of trade to the entire region,” he said. Chairman to the Confederation of Tanzania Industries (CTI) Paul Makanza has asked delegates in the meeting to uphold a rule-based trade relationship as a way to reduce the imposition on non-tariff barriers (NTBs) on cross border trade. The talks will also comprise of business-to-business sessions which are geared at identifying export and import products, investment opportunities, and on best business practices in the two markets.
