A mother of three is presently being held by detectives for allegedly strangling to death two of her children in Jerusalem-Waithaka, Dagorreti sub-county, Nairobi. Diana Kibisi is said to have locked herself with her three children in their single room before killing her 4 and 3 year old sons. Sources close to the family narrated to Citizen Digital that Diana’s mother in-law had traveled from Lugari to Nairobi to help her and her husband Alex Miheso sort out their domestic differences. It is however alleged that things did not go as well as expected since there only arose new disagreements. Diana and Alex later saw off her mother-in-law, after which Diana went back home and grabbed the two children’s necks, strangling them to death. Alex said they had indeed been facing some challenges in their marriage, but that he did not expect things to turn out the way they did, with his wife killing their children. “She called in the evening and asked me to come home, that she has killed the children. She has always threatened to kill our kids, she has always sent me messages threatening to kill the kids,” he claimed.
