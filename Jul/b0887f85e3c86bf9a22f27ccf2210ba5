The national women’s basketball team, Lioness, will launch their hunt for the FIBA Women’s Afrobasket Zone Five ticket on Monday 7pm, against hosts Rwanda. The qualifiers, which ends Saturday, will see four countries-Kenya, Egypt, South Sudan and hosts Rwanda- battle for the sole ticket reserved for the Zone Five countries in the Africa’s biggest basketball tournament set for September in Yaounde, Cameroon. Lionesses, who landed in Rwanda last Friday, will subsequently face South Sudan Tuesday 4pm in their second match before wrapping up the qualifiers being played in a round-robin format, against Egypt on Wednesday. Kenya is eyeing to return back to Afrobasket after their mixed performance at the 2019 edition played in Senegal. The winner of the qualifiers will represent the Zone Five countries at the AfroBasket championship set to tip-off from September 17-26 at the Multipurpose Sports Complex in Yaounde. Also, the winner will join Cape Verde who became the first team to qualify for the show joining host Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali and Mozambique from the last championships as the top four.
