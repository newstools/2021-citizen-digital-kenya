Kenyatta University has become one of the few facilities in the country to have a synthetic track. Engineers from Mondo Track and Field company laid the new synthetic track at the University as a legacy project for the upcoming World Under-20 Championships set for August 17-22 in Nairobi. The University had initially been earmarked to be the Athlete’s Village for the World Under-20 Championships before organisers decided to host athletes in various hotels due to Covid-19 fears. Prof. Vincent Onywera, the Registrar in charge of Research, Innovation and Outreach said the new synthetic track will not only benefit Kenyatta University but the country at large. “We are very excited that the synthetic track is being completed as we gear towards the World Under-20 Championships. This is a national facility that will be used by other institutions in the country. It will host other championships as well including the University Games,” said Onywera. Onywera said the facility will meet international standards similar to that of Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. Also Read: “We expect to see a lot of activities at this facility. As a learning institution we also expect that through this facility we can make a contribution to our new education system- Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) which emphasises on physical education and sports,” he said. The University served as the Games Village during the 2017 World Under-18 Championships. Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
