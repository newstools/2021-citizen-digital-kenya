Led by the former World Championships silver medalist Caleb Mwangangi and national under-20 assistant team manager Joseph Ilovi, the organisers said they will pull out all the stops to ensure the annual race meets international standards. “This region (Southern) is well known for producing top talents in athletics but in recent years it’s as if we’ve started to stagnate and we’re not giving Rift Valley enough challenge. This race is, among other strategies we want to employ to keep churning out many potent talents,” Mwangangi, a 2014 World Indoor Championships winner said. According to the race director Philip Muia, the event organisers are targeting 1000 participants and will feature 15km, 10km and 5km categories for both men and women. The winners for both men and women in each category will receive Sh.50, 000 as prize awards. “The event has been sanctioned by the Athletics Kenya and we’re inviting all the athletes to start registering. The registration fee for the 15km category is Sh.1000, 10km category Sh.500 and Sh. 300 for fun run category.
