Utility Company Kenya Power is expected to physically map out all its 8.2 million customer meters beginning from next week. This as part of the State Corporation quest for efficiency through the exercise which will provide an accurate inventory of its asset and network. The map-out exercise is further seen as a precursor to the company’s plan to automate its grid. “One of the most ground shifting benefits of this data clean-up project is that it will enable the business to undertake precise energy measurement which will turn aid the business in identifying losses’ hotspots so as to facilitate effective remedial action,” said Kenya Power Chief Executive Officer Benard Ngugi. “This is because, once completed, the business will embark on the transformer metering project which will enable the business to accurately compare power fed into a distribution transformer, against power billed so as to pin-point the exact transformers requiring urgent intervention in the war on losses.” Kenya Power has partnered the National Youth Service (NYS) for the new initiative under which NYS personnel will make visits to every customer’s premise to collect customer meter data and meter box coordinates.

The mapping of customer metres will represent the remainder of a digital exercise which has so far seen the digitization of its medium and high voltage network comprising of 83 transmission substations, 295 primary sub-stations and 73,486 transformers. The exercise is also expected to map and estimated 166,000 kilometres of low voltage lines which connect power to customer homes. The excise has been funded by the World Bank under the Kenya Electricity Management Program (KEMP) at a cost of Ksh.225 million.
