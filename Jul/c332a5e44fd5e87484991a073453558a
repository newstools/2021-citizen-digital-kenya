The newly appointed Nairobi City Stars head coach John Amboko has promised to continue with the philosophy that was laid down by the outgoing tactician Sanjin Alagic. Alagic left his role at City last weekend after his contract expired and his successor is keen on building on the foundation laid down by the Bosnian. “He has laid a good foundation of the club that I don’t want to interfere with because we can see the results. I have learnt a lot for him as a player and also being part of the technical bench at the club. We will continue with the good work and keep improving,” said Amboko. Since joining City stars in 2019, Sanjin guided them to earn a promotion to the Premier League and has left Simba wa Nairobi at sixth in the standings with lots of lessons for Amboko to take. “We have to take one game at a time as we are in a crucial moment of the season and we can’t afford to relax. We want stay focused and finish in the best position ever so that when we review the season we know where to improve come next season,” added Amboko, a City Stars legend himself. Amboko’s first assignment will be up against relegation-threatened Vihiga United, a duel he assesses as a complicated one.
