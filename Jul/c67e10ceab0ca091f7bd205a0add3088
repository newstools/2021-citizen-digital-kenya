AFC Leopards are plotting for the downfall of league leaders Tusker FC when they meet in a titanic clash this Friday with an aim of cutting their lead to only five. Ingwe head coach Patrick Aussems says he is preparing for the tie just like any other fixture but putting in mind that three important points are up for grabs. “Yes we play on Friday but this means we have days before that game and a lot of things might happen, so let’s focus on recovering and after that, we will prepare for this game like other games,” Aussems said. Should AFC Leopards win, then the battle for a top finish at the end of the FKF-PL 2020-2021 season will heat up as it gets down to the wire. The Belgian is delighted to see his lads showcase a top-drawer performance in recent matches despite going through difficult times. Ingwe beat the visiting Bandari 2-0 last Friday thanks to Peter Thiong’o and Robert Mudenyu goals at Thika Municipal Stadium.

Ingwe have so far won 13 matches, pulled four draws and lost six in the 23 games they have played so far – with their aim remaining to lift the league title at the end of this season to end a two-decades-long wait. To achieve this target, the Leopards will have to pull off top-notch performances against Tusker, second-placed KCB and even defending champions Gor Mahia among their few remaining matches on the cards.
