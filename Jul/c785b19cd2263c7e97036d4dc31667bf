Manufacturer Unga Limited it’s set to dispose its bakery business represented by the Ennsvalley Bakery Limited. The firm has subsequently entered an asset purchase agreement with BigCold Kenya Limited, a cold storage and logistics company to buy its baking subsidiary out. The completion of the agreement dated July 26 now awaits the ‘satisfaction of certain conditions’. Unga Group holds a 52 per cent controlling stake in Ennsvalley through its Unga Holdings Limited with the bakery involving itself in the baking and sale of cakes, bread and pastries. While Unga has not disclosed reasons for the planned asset disposal, the sale is likely part of initiatives to deliver an improved performance for the Group. The company has for instance recently signaled job cuts after posting an 88 per cent profit decline in its last financial year which ended in June 2020.
