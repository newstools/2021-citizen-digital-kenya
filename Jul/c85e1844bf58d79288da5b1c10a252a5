Police in Bungoma have arrested 11 individuals accused of flouting the 7pm to 4am curfew imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the region. Confirming the arrest, Bungoma County Commissioner Samuel Kimiti said majority of those arrested are boda boda riders and hotel operators. The suspects are set to be arraigned on grounds of flouting COVID-19 protocols. The County Commissioner warned police officers who are reported to be receiving bribes in order to allow entertainment joints to operate beyond the curfew hours. This comes even as the area, which borders Uganda continues to experience a high rate of infection.
