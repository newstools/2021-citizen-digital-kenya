National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has said he will not be deterred in his resolve to contest for the country’s presidency in 2022. Speaking on Monday after presiding over the official launch of ‘Beyond Politics,’ a book by Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi, Speaker Muturi dismissed assertions that he is a political project. Muturi said his bid for the top seat is motivated by a desire to install order and discipline in the management of public affairs. “I preach accountability, and it is for this reason that I have declared that I will be in the ballot for presidential election in 2022,” stated Muturi. “We’ve been in the opposition and held senior positions in the national government, and we know the potential of this country. We have played our roles and now, I want to do more, and I believe that I can do so as the President of the Republic of Kenya.” Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia who attended the launch however called on Mt. Kenya leaders to unite and speak with one voice, warning that the divisions occasioned by Muturi’s installation as a spokesman would result in a loss in 2022. Also Read: “Tuwache hii mambo ya Mt. Kenya East na Mt. Kenya  West, it will not help us. Let’s keep our vote as one bloc, let’s bargain with 14 million votes, it doesn’t matter who becomes the president. We should also go for the presidency, hii mambo ya kutishwa ati tumekaa sana, we had the same problem during Uhuru’s time,” said Governor Kimemia. Governor Murungi, on his part, said: “We, in Mt, Kenya region, have given this country’s its name…that’s why it’s called Kenya, we’re the heart, and we believe whatever formation is made, whatever government comes to power, the Mt. Kenya region should continue playing a central role.”  Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
