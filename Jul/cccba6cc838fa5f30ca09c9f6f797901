Charges could be brought in the United States related to the killing of Haitian President Jovenel Moise, a U.S. senior administration official said on Thursday. Moise was fatally shot on July 7 at his Port-au-Prince home by what Haitian authorities describe as a unit of assassins, including 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans. “If charges can be brought in the United States, they will be brought,” the administration official said. The assassination has pitched the already troubled Caribbean nation into chaos, coming amid a surge in gang violence that has displaced thousands and hampered economic activity in the poorest country in the Americas. U.S. officials traveled to Haiti on Sunday to assess the situation and met three politicians who have all staked competing claims to take charge. The administration official said the United States was not endorsing any political figure in Haiti.
