The Wiper party has written to Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana on why he should not be expelled from the party. Wiper is accusing Kibwana of not toeing the party line as well as undermining party leader Kalonzo Musyoka. The party has given Governor Kibwana 14 days to appear before the disciplinary committee scheduled for next week. However Kibwana says the disciplinary action against him is heavily influenced by the endorsement of his presidential bid by elders from the 22 Kamba clans last week. Akamba Clans Governing Council led by the chairman Boniface Kilonzo and the group’s Secretary-General Davis Maike praised Kibwana saying he has the interest of the community at heart. Speaking in Wote town at the Governor’s residence, the elders said Kibwana beats the rest of Kamba leaders, who have declared interest for the top seat, in negotiating goodies on behalf of the community.
