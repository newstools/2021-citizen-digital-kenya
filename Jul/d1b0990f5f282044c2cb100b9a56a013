The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) has shot down reports that former Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich’s charges have been dropped. In a statement issued on Saturday, the ODPP stated that a news item published in a local publication claiming that Mr Rotich had been cleared of all charges in the misappropriation of public funds case was false. “Contrary to reports appearing in the Business Daily on Friday, 16th July 2021, no charges have been dropped against the former Cabinet Secretary (CS) National Treasury, Henry Rotich, accused of misappropriation of public funds relating to the construction of the Arror and Kimwarer Multipurpose Development Dam Projects,” the statement issued on Saturday reads. The former CS and four others have been charged jointly with a variety of offenses ranging from conspiracy to defraud, abuse of office, and failure to comply with various sections of the law while carrying out contracts that required the Kenyan government to pay approximately Ksh. 63 billion for the construction of the two dams. According to the DPP, when the case came up for plea on the amended charges on May 26, 2021, the former CS objected to the plea being taken on two counts. According to the former Treasury Cabinet Secretary, the two counts did not specify what specifics he was to respond to under the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act and the Public Finance Management Act. In a ruling dated 15th July, 2021, Hon. Douglas Ogoti allowed the application by the prosecution to amend the charges within seven days.
