Nicholas Kimeli will be eyeing a win tonight at Oslo Diamond League meeting in what will be his final outing before the Olympic Games in Tokyo Japan. Kimeli will compete in the men’s 3000m alongside compatriots Jacob Krop, Michael Kibet, Justus Soget and Bethwell Birgen. “I want to run under 7:30 over the 3000m especially this being my last race before the Olympics. I belive I am in the right shape at the moment,” said Kimeli. Kimeli who trains at the Global Sports Communication camp in Kaptagat will be making his Olympic debut at Tokyo Games next month after he won the national trials a fortnight ago. He will team up with compatriots Daniel Simiu and Samuel Chebole. “My target is to make the podium at the Olympics. I think I now have more experience having competed at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and also the 2019 World Championships,” said Kimeli.
