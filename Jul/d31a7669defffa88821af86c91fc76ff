National Super League side Shabana FC have been handed a walkover after Kisumu Hotstars FC failed to show up for a league match that was slated for Saturday 3 June 2021 at the Narok Stadium. With Kisumu Hotstars a no-show, the match officials were left with no option but to award Shabana FC three points and two goals. This is the second time this season Kisumu Hotstars FC have given a walkover. The club, like many others in the NSL are walking on a tight financial rope, making honouring fixtures a nightmare. Last week, several clubs in the Lake Region petitioned the FKF leadership to consider calling off the season as they are struggling to honour matches, away from their regions, after the government banned social and sports events in the regions following an upsurge in Covid-19 cases. The clubs, among them Kisumu Hotstars, argued that playing their home matches away from their home venues gave away the home advantage they enjoyed prior to the government directive.
