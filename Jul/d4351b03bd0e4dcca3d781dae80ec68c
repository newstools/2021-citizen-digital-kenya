Lionel Messi is set to extend his stay at Barcelona by signing a new five-year deal, with the Argentine talisman set to take a wage cut, La Vanguardia newspaper and ESPN reported on Wednesday. Messi, Barca’s all-time top scorer and appearance maker, technically ended his 21-year association with the club last month and is currently a free agent after his previous contract expired.  La Liga chief Javier Tebas said last week that Barcelona, which has a total debt of more than Sh128 billion, would not be shown any leniency. Messi’s last contract, signed in 2017, was the most lucrative in world sport according to a January report in newspaper El Mundo. The club have been trying to rebuild the squad with Junior Firpo, Jean-Clair Todibo and Carles Alena being sold to make way for free signings Sergio Aguero, Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia.
