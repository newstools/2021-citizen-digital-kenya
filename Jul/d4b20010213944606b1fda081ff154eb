A local businessman at the Kagumo trading centre in Kirinyaga County was on Friday stabbed to death by a middle-aged woman for allegedly refusing to settle a pending bill of Ksh.2,000. The deceased’s son Martin Kariuki said his father, 45-year-old Mark Karimi, succumbed to knife injuries at the Kerugoya nursing home. Angry Kagumo residents baying for the woman’s blood burnt her properties at the trading centre accusing her of lying saying the deceased had actually paid the Ksh.2,000. The woman, a trader, was arrested on Saturday morning at 8am and is currently being held at the Kagumo Police Station. Residents said this is the third killing in Kirinyaga this week. On Sunday last week, a 19-year-old woman killed her husband in Ciagini village while a 30-year-old man killed his wife in Kangai.
