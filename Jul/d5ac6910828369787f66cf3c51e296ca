The Internal Affairs Unit of the National Police Service (NPS) has identified and instituted disciplinary action against three traffic officers caught soliciting bribes from matatu operators on Kangundo Road. The officers, in a now viral video recently aired by Citizen  TV, are seen colluding with two members of the public to receive bribes. The traffic police officers stop the matatus plying the Kangundo Road route, and then the two members of the public – a man and a woman – are tasked with approaching the operators and taking the crumpled notes on behalf of the cops. NPS now says its Internal Affairs Unit began investigations promptly after receiving the footage and has now identified the three officers who will face stern action. “Following a video clip that went viral showing three traffic police officers colluding with two members of the public in engaging in misconduct along Kangundo Road, Nairobi, the Internal Affairs Unit, NPS commenced an investigation and positively identified the officers involved,” read a statement from NPS released on Monday. “Stern disciplinary action is being taken against the officers.  Meanwhile. we appreciate Citizen TV for highlighting the matter and do urge members of the public to report to the Unit whenever they identify police officers being involved in acts amounting to corruption or any form of police misconduct.” Also Read: Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
