Kieran Trippier has been recalled to the starting line-up for England’s Euro 2020 final against Italy on Sunday. The Atletico Madrid full-back replaces Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka in the only change from the side that started the semi-final win over Denmark. It will see England revert to the three-man defence that featured in their 2-0 last-16 win against Germany. Gareth Southgate’s men will become the first England side to lift a European Championship if they win at Wembley. England have not won a major tournament since the 1966 World Cup triumph. Midfielder Phil Foden is not in the squad after suffering a minor knock on Friday.
