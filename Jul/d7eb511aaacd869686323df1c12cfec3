Water supply to the Nairobi Central Business District and its environs will be shut down from 6am on Thursday, July 15  to Friday 6am. According to Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company, the disruption is meant to pave way for the construction of the Express Way. Areas that will be affected include the whole of City Centre, South B, South C, and other areas along Mombasa Road. Others are the University of Nairobi main campus, Coca Cola Factory, JKIA, EPZ-Athi River, Industrial Area, and areas along Jogoo Road. Nairobi Water says the shutting down of the water supply will facilitate the interconnection of the new and old pipelines to enable the release of the road corridor to the contractor.
