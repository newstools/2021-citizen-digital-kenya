The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party says it is initiating a formal plan with its National Super Alliance (NASA) partners to revive and strengthen the Alliance ahead of next year’s General Election, to enable them win the presidential election. The party’s National chairman John Mbadi says that ODM is currently initiating talks with other NASA principals and their allies whom they worked with in the 2017 elections to renew a strong united alliance that will move across the nation to lobby for votes so that they can form the next government. Mr. Mbadi says that ODM is still engaging the Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka despite his divergent opinion on the next elections, Moses Wetangula (FORD-K), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC). Speaking on Saturday at Ongalo Primary School in Gwasi North Ward within his Suba South constituency, Mbadi disclosed that ODM cannot go alone as a single party in the elections without looking for other partners with similar ideologies and manifesto to win the elections. The legislator revealed that they are also trying to reach out to KANU party chairman Gideon Moi and other interested parties to join the Alliance since they are aiming at forming an inclusive coalition with a national face. The Suba South MP, who is eyeing the Homa-Bay gubernatorial seat in 2022, also admitted that ODM and Jubilee parties are currently working on modalities of ensuring that they form a pre-election pact that will push them towards winning the 2022 presidential election.
