Two men were arrested on Wednesday while masquerading as officers of the Music Copyright Society of Kenya at Wagusu trading center in Bondo, Siaya County. The two men who had fake job cards were arrested by curious members of the public whom they allegedly wanted to con. According to one of the traders, Edwin Otoyo who led the arrest of the perceived conmen, the duo was entering shops at the trading centre and demanding Music Copyright licences. He told Radio Ramogi that after visiting a few bars, restaurants and barber shops, members of the public got curious and followed them to ascertain if they were truly from the Music Copyright Society. It is at that point that they started interrogating the duo who could not explain themselves and why they had different job cards, all that were fake. Mr. Otoyo told Radio Ramogi that it is at that point that they were frog matched to Kopolo police station where the suspects could not even produce their national identity cards.
