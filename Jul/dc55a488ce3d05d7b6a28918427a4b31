The CAF Women’s Champions League qualifiers for the Cecafa Zonal, which were scheduled to kick off on Saturday in Nairobi,  have been postponed. The East and Central African football association announced Tuesday that, the qualifiers for the inaugural edition of the CAF Women’s Champions League, which were set to run until August 1 will not take place ‘until further notice’. Kenyan representatives Vihiga Queens have been camping in Nairobi for the past two weeks preparing for the tournament. Speaking to Citizen Digital, Cecafa’s secretary general Auka Gecheo said financial constraints from the hosting country forced the association to put the tournament on hold. “We’ve decided to postpone the tournament to an unknown date due to lack of funds to host it. It requires a huge amount of money to accommodate all nine participating teams as well as officials. The move was in conjunction with CAF whom they will have to talk to Football Kenya Federation (FKF) to agree on the new date.” Hosts Vihiga Queens were set to kick off the campaign against FAD Club of Djibouti in Pool ‘C’ on Saturday. The other opponent Scandinavia WFC from Rwanda pulled out citing Covid-19 challenges.
