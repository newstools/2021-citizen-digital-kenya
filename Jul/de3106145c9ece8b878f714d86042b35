AFC Leopards winger Peter Thiong’o has said he feels ‘relieved’ after scoring his first goal since February when he came of the bench winner against Ulinzi Stars at the Kasarani Stadium. Thiong’o scored as a substitute again last Friday during Leopards’ 2-0 win over Bandari FC at the Thika Municipal Stadium, a goal he said meant a lot to him. “I feel relieved to score that goal against Bandari for it has been a very long journey since I scored when we played against Ulinzi. “I have been looking for that scoring touch for a long time and now I’m a happy person for netting against Bandari. It has been pressure after pressure for me to come off the bench in matches and so I just must work harder to force my way back to the first team,” Thiong’o said. Thiong’o has found it hard to get into the Leopards first team since joining the twelve time champions last year from Kakamega Homeboyz. Furthermore, life has not been easy for him since coming to Leopards but he says that he is ready to start firing goals and defenders should be ready for rough times ahead.

Patrick Aussems’ charges face a litmus test this Friday when they battle it out with league leaders Tusker at Thika Municipal stadium from 3pm. Ingwe are third on 43 points eight behind the Brewers but with a game in hand, an opportunity to cut the gap to only five.
