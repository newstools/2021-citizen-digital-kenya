At least 323 people were this past weekend arrested in Nairobi for flouting the COVID-19 protocols in various places. Nairobi County Commander Augustine Nthumbi said some of the culprits were apprehended in bars past curfew hours, while others were gathering in numbers in disregard to the set regulations. The police boss said the majority are those who were found hovering around without masks within the estates. He said the suspects are expected to be arraigned in court and charged on Monday. Separately, a middle-aged man was on Sunday night stabbed to death by his friends following a disagreement over unknown reasons in Embakasi area. Mr. Nthumbi said the police have since launched a manhunt for the murder suspects who escaped immediately after committing the act.
