Nzoia Sugar FC tactician Ibrahim Shikanda is confident his side will pocket all three points when they take on AFC Leopards in their next FKF Premier League fixture on Sunday. Nzoia held their own to force a barren draw against Posta Rangers at the Ruaraka Stadium and Shikanda is bullish ahead of their next assignment. “We are going for the three points and nothing less; we shall score goals, my boys are in good spirit,” Shikanda told Citizen Digital after earning a point against Rangers. Nzoia Sugar FC sit 14th on the FKF-PL log with 22 points from 25 matches while Ingwe are 4th on the standings with 43 points, 12 points behind League leader’s brewers Tusker. Stat attack: Three of Nzoia’s last six matches have produced over 2.5 goals. They have, however, conceded seven goals in those six matches. Players to watch: Hillary Simiyu – the winger has scored in most of Nzoia’s fixtures and contributed to most of the side’s goals.
