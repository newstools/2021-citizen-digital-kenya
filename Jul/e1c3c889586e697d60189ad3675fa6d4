Law Society of Kenya (LSK) President Nelson Havi was released from police custody on Tuesday evening after grilling over assault allegations. Speaking after his release on a Ksh.10, 000 cash bail, Havi claimed his arrest was meant to harass him. He is set to appear in court and take plea on Wednesday. The outspoken LSK boss was nabbed at the LSK offices on Gitanga road and whisked away over accusations that he assaulted the society’s suspended CEO Mercy Wambua. Wambua on Monday alleged that Havi assaulted her during a meeting at the LSK offices. The embattled CEO, in the company of her lawyer Steve Ogolla, recorded a statement at the Muthangari Police Station stating that Havi accosted her in the boardroom where she was to have a meeting. Havi, on the other hand, dismissed the assault claims blaming Wambua for interrupting an ongoing meeting at the boardroom with an intention of eavesdropping and secretly recording the proceedings.

Wambua has since however obtained conservatory court orders to block any arbitrary ejection from office. Havi, in a tweet posted on Monday night, accused the LSK CEO of shielding two of his former predecessors from liability over the alleged plunder of hundreds of millions of the society’s funds.
