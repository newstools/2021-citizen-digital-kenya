Nzoia Sugar FC tactician Ibrahim Shikanda is confident his side will pocket all three points when they take on Kakamega Homeboyz in their next FKF Premier League fixture this weekend. Nzoia held their own to force a 2-2 draw against relegation threatened Western Stima at the ASK Showground in Nakuru and Shikanda is bullish ahead of their next assignment. “We are going for the three points and nothing less; we shall score goals, my boys are in good spirit,” Shikanda told Citizen Digital after earning a point against Stima. Nzoia Sugar FC sit 14th on the FKF-PL log with 21 points from 23 matches while Homeboyz are eight on the standings with 34 points, 17 points behind League leader’s brewers Tusker. Stat attack: Three of Nzoia’s last six matches have produced over 2.5 goals. They have, however, conceded nine goals in those six matches. Players to watch: Hillary Simiyu – the winger has scored in most of Nzoia’s fixtures and contributed to most of the side’s goals.
