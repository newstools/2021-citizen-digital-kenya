After three straight losses, Shujaa finally seized their first win of the Tokyo Olympics thumping hosts Japan 21-7 in the 9-12 place ranking clash. Shujaa had a sluggish start, failing to gather the kick-off which Japan capitalised on as Matsui Chihito received the ball wide to go on a scintillating run and touch down the ball. Kenya however bounced back two minutes later with Alvin Otieno getting his hands on an excellent pass by Jeffrey Oluoch to so comfortably touch down between the sticks. The Innocent Simiyu charges pulled ahead through Oluoch who tore through the Japan defence by utter strength to touch down as Shujaa went into the halftime break leading 14-7. Upon the restart, the experienced duo of Collins Injera and skipper Andrew Amonde bore Kenya’s third try with the assistant skipper feeding his senior to run half the length of the field before placing the ball without much contest. The comforting win however came too late as Kenya were knocked out of medal contention after losing all their Pool C matches to USA, South Africa and Ireland – much to the chagrin of Captain Amonde who could not hold his tears in the Ireland clash post-match interview.
