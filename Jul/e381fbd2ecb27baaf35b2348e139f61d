Law Society of Kenya (LSK) President Nelson Havi has obtained orders from the High Court temporarily blocking his arrest or prosecution for allegedly assaulting suspended CEO Mercy Wambua. The orders, signed by Justice Jairus Ngairah, were directed to the Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI), Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), and the Inspector General of Police. The outspoken LSK boss was given 7 days to apply for file a substantive motion for the judicial review, and the respondents another 7 days to respond upon being served the motion. Havi was on Tuesday nabbed at the LSK offices on Gitanga road and whisked away over the assault allegations. He was later in the evening released from police custody on a Ksh.10, 000 cash bail after grilling, he claimed his arrest was meant to harass him. Wambua alleged that Havi assaulted her during a meeting at the LSK offices on Monday.

Havi, on the other hand, dismissed the assault claims blaming Wambua for interrupting an ongoing meeting at the boardroom with an intention of eavesdropping and secretly recording the proceedings. He insisted that Wambua is a trespasser at LSK offices as a decision had been made during a special general meeting on June 26 to send her on compulsory leave with full pay. Wambua has since however obtained conservatory court orders to block any arbitrary ejection from office. Havi has accused the LSK CEO of shielding two of his former predecessors from liability over the alleged plunder of hundreds of millions of the society’s funds.
