Gor Mahia head coach Sammy ‘Pamzo’ Omollo has slammed his charges for poor defending which he points out to be their main undoing in the winless streak now stretching to seven matches. Gor yesterday lost 1-0 to Ulinzi Stars at the Nakuru Show Grounds, leaving them seventh on the Kenyan Premier League table. “We don’t play well the way we played against Nairobi City stars ,what I didn’t like is we started playing well after we conceded the goal ,nowadays many teams have learnt to defend well after taking the lead and Ulinzi happens to be one of those sides . “We also failed to convert the many set pieces that we got heading forward. This is an area we really need to work on if we are to get positive results in the coming games,” said Pamzo. The coach, who is managing K’Ogalo following the abrupt exit of immediate former boss Manuel Vaz Pinto, is also worried of the bluntness exhibited by the Kenyan record champions. “We are creating chances which we are failing to convert, the problem is we are playing aerial balls in the opponent’s box which are very easy for any team to defend. We need to really improve on that,” added Omollo.

Gor recently let go two of their key players, Kenneth Muguna who joined Tanzania’s Azam and Charles Momanyi who has moved to Tusker FC, leaving more dents in the team.
