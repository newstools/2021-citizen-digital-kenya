Leonardo Bonucci says Italy “are not afraid” to contest the Euro 2020 final on English soil when the two sides face each other on Sunday. Italy beat Spain on penalties after a captivating semi-final at a boisterous Wembley Stadium on Tuesday. “Even though there will be a mostly English crowd, it will give us additional motivation,” Bonucci said. As many as 1,000 Italian fans will be allowed inside Wembley to watch the game. Juventus defender Bonucci, 34, will line up alongside 36-year-old centre-back partner Giorgio Chiellini to face an England team with an average age of 25. Bonucci joked it will be “youngsters against old men” as Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate can call upon the likes of Bukayo Saka, 19, and 21-year-old Jadon Sancho in his attack.

Danish winger Mikkel Damsgaard’s stunning free-kick is the only goal England have conceded in the tournament and Bonucci was quick to praise the Three Lions’ backline. “England have a super defence, I already said this during the qualifying phase,” he said. “They have an excellent midfield, and behind them are [Harry] Maguire and [John] Stones, who had great seasons at Manchester United and [Manchester] City. “We will need to give great attention as a defence and show a lot of cunning to score in attack.” Four-time World Cup winners Italy are looking to lift their first European Championship since 1968 after losing in both the 2000 and 2012 finals.
