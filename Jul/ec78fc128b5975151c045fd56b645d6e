Two police officers on Friday night sustained injuries after shooting each other following an argument over a woman at a popular club on Thika Road. Police Constable Festus Musyoka Kavuthi, who is attached to Starehe DCI, and Police Constable Lawrence Muturi from Kasarani Petty Crime Unit met and an argument ensued between them over a lady who had accompanied the former. PC Musyoka is then said to have withdrawn his pistol and shot PC Muturi on the hand thereby injuring him. In retaliation, PC Muturi also took out his firearm and shot PC Musyoka on the left part of the neck, accidentally also shooting the woman, identified as Felistas Nzisa, on the abdomen. Police officers from Kasarani were alerted about the incident by an anonymous caller at around 9:30pm, upon which they rushed to the scene. PC Musyoka and Ms. Nzisa were rushed to Nehema Uhai Hospital for first aid, after which the officer was transferred to the Nairobi Hospital for further treatment.
