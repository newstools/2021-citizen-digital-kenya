The Commission for University Education (CUE) has cautioned vice-chancellors against engaging other professional bodies in regards to approval of university courses. The commission CEO Mwenda Ntarangwi says if universities continue to engage any other body over courses they have already accredited or approved without due consideration of the commission, then CUE will be forced to withdraw such programmes. “On a sad note, and despite court judgement, some professional bodies continue to engage universities with little regard, if any, to the commission. This is not only contemptuous but disregard to the sub-sector regulator,” said Ntarangwi in a letter copied to all vice-chancellors of universities and principals of colleges. “It has come to the knowledge of the commission that professional bodies continue to purport to accredit or approve academic programmes in universities.” Court of Appeal judges Mohammed Warsame, Daniel Musinga and Fatuma Sichale ruled that CUE is the only body mandated to regulate standards and accredit courses, in consultation with individual universities. Ntarangwi has cautioned VCs not to breach the court decision. “Any university engaging anybody, as far as the accreditation, licensing and recognition of university education (including accreditation/approval of academic programmes) not within an agreed framework with the commission, the commission will decline to accredit/approve such programmes if the same is yet to be accredited/approved,” said Ntarangwi.
