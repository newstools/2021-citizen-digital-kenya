The rugby sevens Shujaa captain Andrew Amonde and Malkia Strikers skipper Mercy Moim held the Kenyan flag hoisted today in Tokyo as the Olympic Games officially began after a one-year postponement. The duo was chosen a week ago by their fellow athletes to represent Kenya at the ceremony – a tradition that represents the official commencement of the Olympic Games. Traditionally, one person has typically served as flag bearer in the Olympics, but this year it was changed to two after the International Olympic Committee encouraged one male and one female to represent each nation as a symbol of gender parity. Archer Shehzana Anwar was Kenya’s flag bearer at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. The event featured athletes from 205 competing nations plus the IOC Refugee Olympic Team and was held main Olympic Stadium in the Japanese capital.
