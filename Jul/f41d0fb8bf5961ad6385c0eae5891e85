The White House on Wednesday said it may be worthwhile to review anti-doping rules in sport after American sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson tested positive for cannabis use. USA Track & Field (USATF) on Tuesday declined to select Richardson to the relay team for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo after she accepted a one-month ban for the prohibited substance, which she said was to cope with her mother’s death. Selectors left her out of the relay team, leaving her only remaining hope of competing at the Games up in smoke. “We know the rules are where they are, maybe we should take another look at them,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a CNN interview, adding that President Joe Biden had paid particular attention to her after the tragedy she endured. “We certainly have to respect the role of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and the U.S. Olympic Committee and the decisions they make,” said Psaki. “But it is sad, and we do wish her luck and look forward to seeing her running, running as the fastest woman in the world, and for years to come.” In response, USADA CEO Travis Tygart said the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was the global arbiter.
