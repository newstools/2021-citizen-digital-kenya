Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) newly appointed Acting Managing Director John Mwangemi has been cleared to take office. This is following an unprecedented reversal directive by the courts citing variance in the processing of a decision made only last week to bar Mwangemi from office. In a ruling made on Tuesday, Employment and Labor Relations Court Judge Byram Ongaya said orders handed down to the port agency did not match those in the court’s possession. Terming the outcome as an error, Justice Ongaya directed that a new order be processed allowing Mwangemi to take office. Mwangemi who was only appointed to the post last week faced immediate opposition with the Commission for Human Rights and Justice terming the appointment as secretive and illegal. Mwangemi is now expected to replace Rashid Salim who also held ranks as KPA’s interim Chief Executive.
