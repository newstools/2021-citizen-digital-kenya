 Kenya’s boxing team, Hit Squad’s Tokyo Olympics campaign ended in agony Tuesday afternoon after Elizabeth Akinyi, the only remaining pugilist in the competition lost  to Mozambique’s Alcinda Panguana in women’s welterweight bout. Her defeat effectively ended Kenya’s quest for an Olympics boxing medal, and the dream of replicating what the late Robert Wangila achieved when he bagged a gold medal in the welterweight category in the 1988 Olympics held in  Seoul, South Korea. Akinyi’s technical knockout (TKO) loss summed up a disappointing outing for Benjamin Musa coached side in the Games. Earlier on Elly Ajowi fell to four-time world light heavyweight champion Julio La Cruz of Cuba in the heavyweight (81kg-91kg) category. The duo’s elimination follows that of Nick Okoth on Saturday in the round of 32, as well as that of  Christine Ongare.
