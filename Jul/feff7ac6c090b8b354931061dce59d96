Football Kenya Federation (FKF) CEO Barry Otieno says they are determined to see the country’s football leagues reach a conclusive end unless the Government enforces fresh curbs on sporting activities. Only about two thirds of the the FKF Premier League season has been played and the current fixture scheduling indicates the remaining 12 rounds should be completed by August 22. Kenya has already selected its representative for the CAF Champions League and Confederation Cup, meaning only the eventual winner of the league title is yet to be decided. “The league will go on as planned until the end of the season because there are five million shillings that the winner has to take home at the end of the season,” Barry said. The federation chief also confirmed the 2021/2022 season is expected to start on September 26. “This season has been very hectic and we understand how intense it has been for the players. We are hopeful for a better end of the season and a good start to a new season,” Otieno said.
