ODM Leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto have once again sharply differed over Constitutional Amendment Bill popularly known as the BBI. Ruto who was in Majengo, Kilifi county says it is a waste of time to talk about BBI and that country should rededicate its resources to developing the country but Raila Odinga insists, only the BBI will bring lasting changes that would improve peoples lives. The two political bigwigs are still traversing various parts of the coast province, and once again they pointed fingers at each other as far as the BBI matter is concerned. Ruto was in Majengo in Kilifi town where he said reviving the economy as well as creating jobs was more crucial than amending the constitution. Raila on the other hand remains categorical, the BBI train will not be derailed. He further argued that constitutional amendments would bring changes that would improve the lives of Kenyans. Raila accused his detractors saying they were against constitutional changes for selfish reasons. Ruto on the other hand has argued that changes in the constitution would only serve to benefit very few individuals one of them being the ODM leader. Ruto and his brigade continue to insist that BBI is dead, but Raila’s camp disagrees. The tour of the coastal region by the two leaders is aimed at marshalling support for their political camps with just slightly over a year before the next presidential elections.
