Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has hit out at the individuals responsible for vandalising a road sign named after him in Kileleshwa. Atwoli, in a statement released on Tuesday, said the vandals will be haunted for life by their actions. The trade unionist however expressed nonchalance at the act of burning down the road sign saying it will not affect him as he is already known world over. According to Atwoli, the road signage was put up in his honour by the Nairobi County government following his years of service to the city. “Bringing down an honorary road signage under my name doesn’t hurt me. On the flip side, it will haunt, for life, those who are behind it. For how does it benefit them? How do you sleep at night knowing you are a vandal?” He posed. “My name is all over the world and one doesn’t require a street signage for them to know who Francis Atwoli is. The name will live in posterity taking into account my years of selfless service to the workers in Kenya and the world. “ Also Read: He further added: “If anything, the signage was just an act of honour bestowed to me by Nairobians taking into account my many years of service.” Images of the Francis Atwoli road sign, formerly named Dik Dik road, in Kileleshwa being burnt down emerged on social media on Tuesday. This came following the announcement that Atwoli was on Monday morning re-elected for a record fourth time as a Member of the International Labour Organization (ILO) governing body in Geneva, Switzerland, for the period 2021-2024. The road which was named in honour of the trade unionist in May this year was removed by unknown people shortly after that, before Atwoli announced that the county government had re-erected it and put CCTV in place to monitor it from vandals.
