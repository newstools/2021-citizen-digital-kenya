Thika Queens striker Mwanahalima ‘Dogo’ Adam says she is optimistic of bagging the golden boot at the culmination of  Kenyan Women Premier League (KWPL) season. Dogo, who rose from St John’s Girls Kaloleni in Kilifi County to become one of the best strikers in the country, has so far netted 15 goals –  putting Thika on top of Zone A league with 36 points after Rounds of 12. “I can say this is because of the hard work within the team and individual efforts. I had few goals but of late, I have been scoring more than one goal in each game, something which has boosted my number to 15 so far. “I want to thank my teammates for always delivering the assists. I want them to continue with the same spirit so that I can clinch the Golden boot award – I am very optimistic,” said Mwanahalima in an interview with Citizen Digital. Mwanahalima is joint top scorer with Vihiga Queens forward Terry Engesha and Violet Nanjala of Trans Nzoia Falcons as Ruth Chebungei from Wadadia follow in that order with 12 goals. However, apart from eying the Golden boot award, the former Mombasa Olympic goal poacher believes that Thika Queens has all that it takes to clinch the Zone A league this season.
