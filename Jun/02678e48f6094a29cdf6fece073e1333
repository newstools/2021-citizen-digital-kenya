Police in Migori County are pursuing an ex-convict accused of killing a 12-year-old girl whose body was retrieved from a trench on June 4, 2021 after she had been missing for three days. Migori County Commissioner Boaz Cherutich said the death of the girl, identified as Caroline Atieno Otieno, was previously reported as a drowning incident. According to Mr. Cherutich, however, investigations later established that the Sony Primary School pupil was murdered and her body dumped in the trench. The County Commissioner said they suspect the girl was killed by an ex-convict who was recently released from the Kisumu Maximum Prison. He said preliminary investigations established that the girl was spotted on numerous occasions supplying water to the ex-convict who was living an isolated life. Mr.Cherutich said they have since instructed police officers from the criminal investigations department to apprehend the suspect who is currently at large.
