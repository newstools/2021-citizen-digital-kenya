Kariobangi Sharks head coach William Muluya says they are shifting their attention to the league after they were knocked out of the FKF Cup by Gor Mahia FC at the quarterfinal stage. Gor triumphed thanks to goals from Abdul Karim and Sydney Wahongo, ending Sharks’ hopes for a second cup success in three years. Muluya says their aim now is to try and be at the top of the table by 30th of this month and seal the ticket to the CAF champion’s league then focus on winning the league. “Gor took their chances they created and won the game. We gave them a tough time and our attention now turns to the league which we believe has a chance of making history by winning the title. “The race to be top by 30th June makes it even more interesting because every game before the set date is like a final,” Muluya said. Godfrey Shiveka missed a penalty minutes into the second half as Kariobangi Sharks looked more determined to get an equalizer but despite the loss Muluya will not want to blame the loss on the miss.
