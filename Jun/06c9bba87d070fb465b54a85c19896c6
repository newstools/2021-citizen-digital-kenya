Kenya Simbas head coach Paul Odera is set to name his final 25-man squad ahead of the Rugby World Cup 2023 qualifiers that will be competed over the next two weeks. Initially, a total of 102 players were picked for the camp before Odera later whittled the squad to 50 and now he will be naming his final list who will take part in the championship which also doubles up as the next year’s Rugby Africa Cup 2022 qualifiers. “The turn up was great and there was a good commitment with 95% out of 100% where players pushed themselves to make it to the final squad to represent Kenya over the next two weeks,” said Odera. Simbas are scheduled to play Senegal on Saturday before taking on Zambia four days later at the RFUEA grounds, Nairobi. The top two teams from this Pool, which also has Zambia, will join four other teams from Pools A & C for the 2022 Rugby Africa Cup which will double up as Qualifying for the 2023 Rugby World Cup for Africa. Teams will compete for a sole direct qualification spot into the final World Cup tournament and for one place in the final repechage competition.

He, however, said 17 players have missed the camp through injuries, work station commitments and some on national duty with the Sevens side Shujaa-for the Olympics-but Odera is beaming with confidence ahead of the championship. “Herman Humwa, Jacob Ojee, Nelson Oyoo, Antony Omondi, Harold Anduvate and Vincent Onyala are with Shujaa while Peter Kilonzo got a concussion and Geoffrey Okwach getting a foot injury,” explained Odera.
