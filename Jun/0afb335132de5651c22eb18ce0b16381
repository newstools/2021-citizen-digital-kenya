Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) Wilson Sossion has resigned from the position he has held since 2013. Sossion, who is also a nominated Member of Parliament, stepped down from the influential position a day before the Union’s elections scheduled for Saturday at Ruaraka grounds in Nairobi. He made the announcement in a press briefing in Nairobi flanked by his immediate family members including his wife and children. No KNUT official was  present during the resignation. “In the interest of KNUT continuity and its membership, I hereby on June 25, 2021 bow out of KNUT leadership honorably. I shall remain loyal to KNUT and will always be available to advice and support the leadership of the union,” said Sossion. In statement, Sossion urged the government not to muzzle the teachers’ union by failing to remit statutory contributions from members. “I trust that the government of Kenya, as I exit, because that there has been this argument that as long as Sossion stays the government will not release union dues…. I’m making this passionate appeal that the government will find it necessary to allow union dues flow to KNUT so that the leadership and workers earn a salary,” he said.
