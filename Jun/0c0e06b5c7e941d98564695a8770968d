Simone Inzaghi has been named the new Inter Milan coach on a two-year deal, replacing Antonio Conte, the Serie A champions confirmed on Thursday. “FC Internazionale Milano would like to welcome Simone Inzaghi to the Club, as our new First Team Coach: the Italian manager has signed a two-year deal with the Nerazzurri,” read a club statement. Inzaghi stepped down as Lazio manager after 22 years at the club as a coach and a player last week, and takes over from Conte, who resigned despite guiding Inter to a first Serie A title since 2010 this season. Conte’s two seasons at the club were very impressive: he led Inter to runners-up finishes in Serie A and the Europa League in his debut campaign, before winning the league title this year. The 51-year-old’s ambitions to improve his squad were at odds with the club’s financial situation, with Inter reportedly looking to slash the wage bill by 15-20% and make 70-100 million euros from player sales before next season. Inzaghi had been at Lazio since joining as a player in 1999, winning the Serie A title and three Coppa Italias as a striker before hanging up his boots in 2010.
