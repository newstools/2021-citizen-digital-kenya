Former world marathon record holder Tegla Loroupe has urged the government to put more investment in sport, saying it has huge potential to benefit the local economy. Loroupe added there needs to be more focus on the overlooked events such as badminton, archery, judo and karate whose competitors in the country lack the right facilities to match global opposition. The 43-year-old was speaking after four refugees from Kenya were selected from the Tegla Loroupe Foundation to form part of the International Olympic Committee Refugee Team ahead of next month’s Olympic Games. “Our government should put their first priority in sports facilities because sports improve economies. Eventually it will also help the country in producing good athletes in different disciplines,” Loroupe said. The Refugee Olympic Team is composed of 25 Refugee Athlete Scholarship-holders from 11 countries who have been living and training in 13 host countries representing 12 sports disciplines. Four additional athletes from the International Judo Federation Refugee Project complete the mixed judo team, raising the number of team members to 29. Loroupe will again take charge of the refugee team made up of competitors from around the globe set to take part in various sports in Tokyo after she led a similar team at the 2016 Games.
