African Games 5000m champion Lilian Kasait edged two-time world champion Hellen Obiri to win the women’s 5000m as Kenyan Olympic trials kicked off on Thursday. Kasait, the 2017 world cross country bronze medalist clocked 14:52.18 with Obiri coming home second in 14:52.51 as Agnes Tirop closed the podium in 14:52.51 “I didn’t expect to win since it was a very strong field. I am happy to qualify for the Olympics for the first time. I know we have a very huge task ahead at the Tokyo Games,” said Kasait. On her part, Obiri said she is keen to exit the global stage on a high at the Tokyo Games. “You know the age is also catching up and I think this will be my last Olympics, I will try to win a gold medal in Tokyo before I shift to road running,” Obiri said. The Olympic silver medallist said she is yet to decide if she will do double events at the Summer Games.
