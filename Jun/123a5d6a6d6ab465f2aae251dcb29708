Ugandan Minister for Works and Transport General Katumba Wamala who escaped an attempted assassination on Tuesday is out of danger. General Wamala, a former army commander, underwent a successful operation to remove one of the bullets lodged in his body. Doctors could however not remove a second bullet as it had affected his arteries. Gunmen on a motorbike sprayed bullets at the car carrying the minister, killing his daughter and driver in the process. In a series of tweets on Wednesday, he thanked the rider of a boda boda for taking him to hospital in the capital, Kampala.
