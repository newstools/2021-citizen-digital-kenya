Bandari FC head Coach Andre Casa says he is content with his players after they rediscovered their scoring touch. The Dockers are inching closer to defending the FKF Cup, and on Wednesday afternoon they take on little known Equity FC in the cup quarter final match aiming to storm to the semis. The defending champions won by 5-1 and 5-0 in their previous rounds against Dimba Patriots and Sigalagala TTI respectively and Casa Mbungo is optimistic that the scoring touch will guide them past the bankers as they eye a ticket to the Confederations Cup. “We are returning back to our form, game by game, and we hope to win our next encounter which will keep alive our dream of defending the cup,” said the Rwandan tactician. He added, “Scoring many goals is also a morale booster and a challenge to score more for the boys.” Meanwhile the team has been boosted with a clean bill of health ahead of the duel, offering Mbungo a chance to rotate his squad.

In another quarterfinal set for Thursday, Gor Mahia will be chasing a semi-final slot against Kariobangi Sharks with Bidco United and Nairobi City Stars competing in the other fixture. Football Kenya Federation has congested the fixtures as they rush to beat CAF deadline for the submission of Kenya representatives to the continental championships. Confederation of African Football had issued a 30th June deadline for all countries intending to participate in next season’s CAF Champions League and Confederation Cup to submit the names of their representatives.
