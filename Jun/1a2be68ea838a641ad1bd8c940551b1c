England manager Gareth Southgate said on Tuesday his side will be considered to have failed if they do not reach the semi-finals of Euro 2020. England made the last four of the 2018 World Cup in Russia and London’s Wembley Stadium will host the semi-finals and final as well as some group stage games. Asked if going out before the semis would be seen as a failure, Southgate told reporters: “Yes, it probably will. I think we’re realistic about that, we have to live with that expectation. “We know the excitement around the team and it’s great, we’re now relevant. England also made it to the semi-finals of the Nations League in 2019 as well as Euro 1996, played in England. Southgate, speaking after announcing his final squad, said expectations were greater now than during the last World Cup, even with England having one of the youngest squads.
