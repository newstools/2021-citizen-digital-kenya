Anthony Gathu scored a superb hat-trick as Bidco United crushed Twyford FC 7-0 in an FKF Cup round of 32 clash at the Thika Municipal Stadium on Wednesday. Bidco controlled the proceedings from start to finish in a display of total domination over their rivals, with the result coming just three days after their emphatic 3-1 league victory over AFC Leopards. David Orem, Stephen Ombukio (brace) and Eric Gichimu were also on target for Bidco who thus advanced to the round of 16 where they will face Egerton University. Later at the same venue, Collins Shichenje scored a long range effort as Leopards edged Posta Rangers 1-0 to book a last 16 slot against Bungoma All Stars who thrashed Nation FC 3-0. Bidco head coach Anthony Akhulia, who made seven changes from the side that beat Leopards on Sunday, said the run of results were testament to the good progress they are making as a team. “We have been taking each game at a time, and the effort, dedication and hard work put in place have been replicated with the results you seeing. Also Read: “I am happy with the depth of the team, given that we have more important games upcoming, and I am hopeful we shall continue with the same positive and impressive results,” Akhulia said. Leopards head coach Patrick Aussems recalled Collins Shichenje and Isaac Kipyegon back to starting role after serving their red card suspension with Robinson Kamura starting on the bench. After a disappointing loss to Bidco, Leopards needed to bounce back to winning ways and were forced to toil by Posta, who came close through Eliud Lukuwam and Michael Apudo. The winner of the tournament will walk away with Sh2 million prize money as well as a chance to take part in the CAF Confederations Cup. -Report by Godfrey Ashiali and Benson Mbare Video Of The Day: CAS Rachel Shebesh and athlete Asbel Kiprop share their mental health journeys
