The Konza Technopolis Development Authority (KoTDA) has discounted part of its land fees as it woos investors to the project. The agency says it has discounted its standard premium charge for investors paying the premium by December 31 this year and ready to start construction before December 2022. ICT Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng says the government is committed to support investors in taking up space at the future Technopolis and bringing the futuristic City into reality. “Our commitment, as a government is reinforced by our actions and in the recent budget allocation for the year 2021/2022, we as the parent ministry have set aside over 70 percent of the budget for the development of this project,” he said. Investors who have since made payments for their land parcels have been giving access to spaces. This include the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited (KETRACO), the National Construction Authority (NCA), Sosian Energy, Bigen Global and Vinjay Sandhu.

About 40 per cent of 400 acres representing the first phase of the project have been taken up by investors with the government allocating Ksh.18 billion for the project in the new financial year. The project’s anchor tenant is the Kenya Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) which is set to admit its first lot of students in 2023. Konza is expected to generate 17,00 direct jobs at the end of Phase 1 and have 200,000 residents at the end of 2030, the City’s scheduled completion date.
