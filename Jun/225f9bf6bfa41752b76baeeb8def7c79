By Vincent Anguche Kenyans will now have their passports delivered at their doorsteps, this follows the signing of a memorandum of agreement between Posta Kenya and the Department of Immigration on Thursday. Immigration Director General Alexander Muteshi said the initiative will reduce the numerous unnecessary trips by applicants to Nyayo House. Henceforth, Kenyans will only be required to make a single visit to the immigration offices to submit the hard copy of the application and give their biometrics. On his part, PostMaster General Dan Kagwe said the partnership will ensure proper service to all caliber of Kenyans through the wide Posta network in the country and reduce contact due to the COV ID-19 pandemic. Over 156,000 passports have been delivered since the initial inception of the services in September 2020.
