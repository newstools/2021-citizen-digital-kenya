Kenyan rally driver Carl Tundo has exuded confidence in performing well in the World Rally Championship (WRC) that is scheduled for this week starting Thursdays in Naivasha. Ahead of the event, the Equator African Rally Championship winner was however quick to note that the global event posed challenges unlike in the past. This came as Safaricom stepped in to sponsor Tundo and his co-driver Tim Jessop with Sh3.5m for the four-day rally contest. Speaking in Enashipai Spa in Naivasha during the ceremony, Tundo said unlike in the past, this year’s event had more powerful cars and the routes were tricky. “Though we have vast experience, we expect this rally to be competitive as the cars have changed, we have younger drivers and the routes are new,” he said. While thanking Safaricom for the sponsorship, Tundo added that he would use his vast wealth of experience to support upcoming young drivers.
