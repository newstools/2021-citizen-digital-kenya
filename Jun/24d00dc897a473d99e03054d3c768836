The Ministry of Health on Tuesday sounded the alarm over an increase in the number of cases of the Indian Variant ‘Delta’ in the Lake Region. Acting Health Director-General Dr. Patrick Amoth said the more lethal virus variant is now dominant in the country. Dr. Amoth said health facilities in the region could be overwhelmed by the surging numbers as the Delta variant is spiraling out of control. “The COVID-19 situation in the country is still quite volatile, we’re reporting more cases especially from the Western part of the country predominantly of the Delta variant which is of concern because it is more transmissible and leads to more serious illness of COVID-19,” he said. “We’ve had meetings with the Lake Region Economic Bloc leadership and we’re sharing the data and what is emerging is that the variant is now the one that is predominantly driving this phase of the pandemic.” The Indian Delta variant has spread from Kisumu to Siaya and Vihiga counties. The Ministry of Health is now urging Kenyans to be extra vigilant and follow all protocols. Also Read:  Video Of The Day: CAS Rachel Shebesh and athlete Asbel Kiprop share their mental health journeys
