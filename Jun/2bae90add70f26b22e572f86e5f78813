Senior Counsel Otiende Omollo now claims that the promoters of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) Bill were were Dennis Waweru and MP Junet Mohamed The lawyer stated in his submissions to the Court of Appeal on Tuesday that President Uhuru Kenyatta was not the promoter of the Bill and simply supported it like any other Kenyan. “Against all controverted evidence, the promoters of this initiative were Dennis Waweru and Junet Mohamed, the court insists on finding President Kenyatta as the promoter. Anyone can support the initiative,” Omollo said on Wednesday. “ According to the Senior Counsel, the court erred in its decision, especially because the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) recognizes Mr. Waweru and MP Junet as the Bill promoters. At the same time, he claimed that the IEBC had mandated the two and not President Kenyatta to collect signatures in support of the Bill. The issue of signature verification arose during the submissions, with lawyer Omollo arguing that the IEBC was supposed to verify one million registered voters, not one million signatures. According to the lawyer, Kenyan law does not require every Kenyan to have a signature, and no repository of signatures exists. IEBC lawyer Eric Gumbo told the court that it is currently impossible to conduct a forensic audit of one million signatures, claiming that a single document requiring verification from the DCI takes at least one month. “Is it possible to have a forensic audit of at least 1 million signatures? We do not have a database of signatures, a document requiring verification from DCI, takes minimum 1 month, we have 3.4 million signatures to verify,” Gumbo said.
