Gennaro Gattuso is not being considered as a candidate to become the new Tottenham manager. The Italian, 43, left the manager’s role at Fiorentina on Thursday, 23 days after being appointed. The prospect of him joining Spurs prompted a fan protest, which was communicated to the club by the Tottenham Hotspur Supporter Trust. The club had not commented on Gattuso but it is understood they are now looking elsewhere. On Thursday, Spurs ended talks with former Roma manager Paulo Fonseca. Fonseca, 48, is understood to be stunned by the developments, with negotiations reportedly so far advanced that discussions had taken place about potential signings.

Some on social media referenced controversial comments the former Italy midfielder had previously made on subjects such as same sex marriage and women in football. “We can and do communicate supporter sentiment to the decision makers at the club, and have done so very clearly on this occasion” the Tottenham Hotspur Supporter Trust tweeted. “We are aware of and acting on your concerns around potential managerial candidates.” Earlier in June, Spurs had also been in advanced talks with former Inter Milan and Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, while also trying to persuade their former manager Mauricio Pochettino to leave his role at Paris St-Germain. It is now nearly two months since Mourinho was sacked after 17 months in charge. BBC Online Video Of The Day: CAS Rachel Shebesh and athlete Asbel Kiprop share their mental health journeys
