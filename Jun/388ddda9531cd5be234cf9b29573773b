AFC Leopards captain Robinson Kamura has predicted that the race to be crowned league champions in the season 2020-2021 will go down to the wire. The Leopards central-back argues that teams are more mature and ambitious to put something in the cabinet hence the tough run of matches being played. Leopards pulled a 2-2 draw against Sofapaka in their last fixture and Kamura thinks the league is a no joke as they face bottom-placed side Mathare United this afternoon at Ruaraka grounds. “We are taking each game at a time and our focus is on Mathare United tie. Many teams are fighting for maximum points but you realize that at one point, they lose some matches which reflects the stiffness and how tough our league is. “When we lose to a certain team that does not mean that it happens only to AFC Leopards and that is a clear indication that the title race will go down to the final match to unearth who will be crowned the champion,” said Kamura. Kamura is happy to see this season is more interesting with the way every team have pulled out their trigger to post good results no matter where they sit on the table.

Ingwe sit fourth on the standings with 38 points four behind leaders KCB who have played one more match.
