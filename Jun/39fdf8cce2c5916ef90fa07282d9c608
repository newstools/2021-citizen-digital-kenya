AFC Leopards are desperate to end their league title drought and will push to end this season according to the club’s central defender Robinson Kamura. Leopards have enjoyed a strong start to their campaign and have the opportunity to go top of the FKF Premier League standings on Wednesday afternoon if they beat Sofapaka FC in Wundanyi. Leopards last lifted a league title in 1998 and haven’t come close to reclaiming it in recent years, finishing second just once over the last decade. “We are going for maximum points although I know it won’t be an easy match. The most important thing is for the team to keep winning so as to push for the league title this season. “The league is something we have not won in many years and so we want to end that. The rest of things that people are talking about aren’t as important as the league trophy because Leopards is a big team,” Kamura said. Ingwe are in the FKF Cup final where they will face arch-rivals Gor Mahia FC. Also Read: Video Of The Day: CAS Rachel Shebesh and athlete Asbel Kiprop share their mental health journeys
