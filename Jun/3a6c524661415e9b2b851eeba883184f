A contingent of armed police officers on Saturday stopped a recruitment drive by The Service Party (TSP) membership organised in Chogiria Ward, Maara constituency, Tharaka Nithi County. The meeting was led by TSP leader Mwangi Kiunjuri and a host of aspirants eyeing various seats in the next General Elections. Police lobbed tear gas canisters to disperse the leaders who had attended the meeting. The officers also lobbed tear gas canisters at journalists who were interviewing the politicians leading to the address ending prematurely. Kiunjuri has since condemned the interruption and accused the government of what he termed as political intolerance. “As we speak, there are already people who are holding meetings in other places…including in the house of a Member of Parliament that is already going on,” said Kiunjuri.
