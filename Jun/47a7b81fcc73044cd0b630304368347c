Gor Mahia FC have retained a core of its first team players for Thursday’s FKF Cup round of 32 clash against CUSCO FC at the Utalii Grounds in Nairobi. Vic-captain Philemon Otieno will skipper the squad with Kenneth Muguna, Charles Momanyi, Ernest Wendo and Jules Ulimwengu all starting. Gor assistant coach Sammy Omollo had said they would give the regular starters a rest ahead of a tight schedule in the FKF Premier League. Captain Haron Shakava has benched alongside South Sudanese striker Tito Okello. ‘’We want to give our regulars who have overplayed a rest for today. Our schedule is so tight and overworking our players can work to our disadvantage,’’ said Pamzo. Gor advanced to this stage by eliminating Congo Boys by a 3-0 margin in Mombasa with John Macharia, Tito Okello and Clifton Miheso on target.

Should they win in this tournament and fail to clinch the league title, they will still represent the country at the CAF Confederations Cup.
