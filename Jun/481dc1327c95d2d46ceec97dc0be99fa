Education Cabinet Secretary Prof. George Magoha has instituted a ban on unauthorised rallies and meetings being held in schools. Prof. Magoha, in a statement released to newsrooms on Saturday, said the reason for such an action is that the said gatherings could expose learners to COVID-19. “It has come to the attention of the Ministry of Education that various groups of people are targeting schools as venues for holding unauthorised meetings,” said the CS. “By holding the meetings at the school facilities, the groups are exposing learners to the dangers of COVID-19 as many of the attendees do not comply with the Ministry of Health guidelines on COVID-19.” Prof. Magoha stated that, henceforth, school compounds will not be accessible to individuals or groups seeking to hold such gatherings. He further warned that firm action will be taken against individuals or groups found to be flouting the ban.
