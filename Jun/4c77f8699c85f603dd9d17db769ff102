Austria forward Marko Arnautovic has been suspended by Uefa for one match after being found guilty of “insulting another player” in Sunday’s Euro 2020 win over North Macedonia. Arnautovic, who has Serbian heritage, had to be restrained by captain David Alaba as he celebrated his late goal. The 32-year-old was found guilty of misconduct, with Uefa not considering his actions to be discriminatory. Arnautovic, who was born in Austria and has a Serbian father, apologised for his goal celebration in a post on Instagram. He wrote: “There were some heated words yesterday in the emotions of the game for which I would like to apologise, especially to my friends from North Macedonia and Albania. “I would like to say one thing very clearly: I am not a racist. Also Read: “I have friends in almost every country and I stand for diversity. Everyone who knows me is aware of that.” Serbia does not recognise the independence of its former province Kosovo, while there is historic tension between Serbia and North Macedonia. Austria’s next game is against the Netherlands at the Johan Cruyff arena on Thursday, while North Macedonia face Ukraine.
