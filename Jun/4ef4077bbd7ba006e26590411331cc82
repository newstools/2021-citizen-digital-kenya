Some 494 athletes are set to compete at the World Under-20 trials that begin on Thursday at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. Athletics Kenya (AK) and the World Under-20 Local Organising Committee will also use the three-day event to gauge Kenya’s readiness to host the World Under-20 Championships set for August 17-22 at Kasarani. AK Director for Youth Development Barnaba Korir said the first two athletes to cross the finish line at the trials will secure slots in team Kenya with Kenya set to field athletes in 22 disciplines. “We are having a big number partly due to the pandemic which led to the postponement of this event last year. We had already selected some athletes but we decided to give each athlete an opportunity to try their chance at the trials,” said Korir. World Under-20 CEO Mike Rabar said strict Covid-19 protocols including regular tests have been put in place to ensure safety of athletes and support personnel during the trials amidst Covid-19 threat. “Being able to run this event around Covid-19 protocols is going to be tough but it has to be done. Therefore there will be a series of tests to be carried across the three days which for us is going to be a mirror of what will happen during the main event in August,” Rabar said.

We will require all of them to produce original birth certificates, passports or even baptism certificates. I want to warn those who think they can use shortcuts of dire consequences,” he said.
