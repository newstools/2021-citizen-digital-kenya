The Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) has been declared unconstitutional by the High Court in a verdict delivered on Friday in a suit filed by the Law Society of Kenya. The ruling comes a day after High Court Judge James Aaron Makau ruled that Executive Order No. 1 of 2020, dated January 14, 2020, placing the country’s judiciary under the control of Kenya’s executive branch, led by President Uhuru Kenyatta, was unconstitutional. “A declaration is issued that the Executive Order No. 1 of 2020 purporting to organise the Government and set out Judiciary and it Tribunals, Commissions and Independent bodies under Ministries and Government departments as unconstitutional, null and void ” the High Court ruled The Executive Order also established the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS), one of President Uhuru’s projects to revitalize the capital city. The NMS, led by Major General Mohamed Badi, was then transferred to President Kenyatta’s command. Among the institutions that would have been transferred to Executive control were the Judicial Service Commission, the Public Service Commission, the Kenya National Commission of Human Rights, and the Independent Boundaries and Electoral Commission.
