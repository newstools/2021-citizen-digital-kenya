More than 300 livestock farmers in Samburu Central Sub-county are benefiting from a dairy goat distribution program. The program is costing Samburu County Government more than Ksh.3 million to improve milk production, food security and fight poverty among families. Each of the 100 farmers drawn from different villages in Waralal ward who turned up at Nomotio livestock improvement center got a dairy goat at no cost. Some beneficiaries expressed their hope that the program will empower them against hunger and poverty. “I’m very happy because I will feed this goat and ensure that I’m producing milk of which some I will sell and use the money to buy food and this will benefit my family and eradicate poverty,” Ms Janirica Akiru, a beneficiary said. The County’s CEC in charge of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Benedict Lentumunai said another two hundred goats will be distributed to farmers in Ang’ata Nanyukie, Porro and Loosuk wards in the coming days.
