Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST RFC) assistant coach John Asila says his club will upset Nondescripts as Kenya Cup resumes this weekend. Asila says newcomers MMUST are not afraid of their experienced rivals saying they’re prepared for the match and they are ready to go toe to toe for the win. “We expect to give our best against Nondies on Saturday having in mind that they’ve been in the league for a long time, have experienced players and the resources so we’re going to do our bit which is to win the match,” said Asila. The former Kenya under 19 commonly known as Çhipu’ assistant coach disputed claims that teams in the outskirts of Nairobi are more prepared because they’ve been training during the long break. “That’s a lie the Covid 19 curfew affects us all and for us when the university closes we also close as a club and there is no training but we advice our players to do fitness, running and going to the gym individually so that when we come back we do only the basics of the game,” said Asila. Asila added even rugby players in Nairobi can also do the same training individually so no team is special as the league resumes.

MMUST RFC hosts Nondies at the Kakamega Showground from 1:00 pm. Video Of The Day: CAS Rachel Shebesh and athlete Asbel Kiprop share their mental health journeys
