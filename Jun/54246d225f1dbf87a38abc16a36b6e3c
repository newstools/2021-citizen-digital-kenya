Basketball leagues will not resume in the country as earlier stated, the country’s national federation has just days after it released fixtures indicating resumption was due this weekend. Kenya Basketball Federation secretary Ambrose Kisoi says there are operational and logistical issues that need fixing before leagues can be restarted and a meeting has been planned on Saturday for the same. “There are things we agreed to put in place so that whatever we agree on can be sustained for some time so the committee is again meeting over the weekend to shed more light,” Kisoi said. Kisoi has added that the leagues and competition committee has been expanded to include medic and that there will be a full house meeting including the team managers on Monday to give way forward. “We expanded the leagues and competition committee with additional people especially the medics so that we have a broader discussion and by Monday they will have advised us on the roadmap of reopening,” he added The leagues were halted in March when the government suspended all sporting activities in the country due to the rise of Covid-19 infections. The leagues were earlier anticipated to start on May 15 but failed to tip off and will now fail again to tip off tomorrow June 5. Ten games had been scheduled to take place on Saturday and Sunday and were to be played at University of Nairobi grounds. When the league was suspended some teams had played four to five games out of the 22 league matches in a season.
