The Government paid Ksh. 1.8B to ghost students in secondary schools in the 2019-2020 financial year. This is according to Auditor General’s report that showed massive wastage in the ministry that often claims to be underfunded by the exchequer. In the damning report, the Auditor claims that the overpayment arose from ‘’erroneous computations of July and September, 2019 disbursements, inflation of enrolment numbers in January, 2020 and double payments to some schools’’. The report signed by Auditor General Nancy Gathungu claim that the overpayment of subsidies was to two thousand six hundred and ten (2610) public secondary schools in different counties. That was not the only anomaly with the education ministry, as the Auditor General also found that Ksh. 26.8M was send to schools whose existence was in doubt. The report says the 5 schools the monies were disbursed to had questionable status as they didn’t have registration certificates, Teachers Service Commission (TSC) appointment letters and posting of the Principals, Boards of Management minutes approving opening of bank accounts and other documents required under the State Department for Early Learning and Basic Education annual guidelines on disbursement of Free Day Secondary Education Funds (FDSE). ‘’In the circumstances, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy and validity of the reported subsidies of Kshs.58,778,993,798 for the year ended 30 June, 2020.” The report says. The ministry was also put on the spot over the expenditure of millions of shillings being payment of rental charges for office space for various State Department’s offices in the counties. The Auditor claimed she could not authentic payment of KSh. 86M paid for rent because valid lease agreements and approvals for the procurement of the offices were not provided for audit verification.
