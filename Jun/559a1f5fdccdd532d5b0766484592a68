Nzoia Sugar FC head coach Ibrahim Shikanda is confident his side will bag the three points when they take on KCB in an FKF-PL match on Wednesday at Kasarani International Sports Centre. This is despite their poor form that has seen them collect only three points in 10 outings so far, while highflying KCB are only second to leaders Tusker FC, with 43 points. Nzoia lost 0-1 to Nairobi City Stars in their last match played in Narok, and Shikanda is bullish his boys will aim to bounce back to winning ways against the bankers. “We are going for three points and nothing less, our matches against KCB have mostly been evenly balanced so we are optimistic,” Shikanda told Citizen Digital. Nzoia Sugar FC sit 14th on the FKF-PL log with 17 points from 20 matches while KCB are second on the standings with 43 points, just one point shy of leaders brewers Tusker. Stat attack: Three of Nzoia’s last six matches have produced over 1.5 goals. They have, however, conceded eight goals in those six matches.
