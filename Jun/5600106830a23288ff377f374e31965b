Shabana head coach Robert Ojienda is confident his charges have what it takes to upset second-placed Kenya Police who are on a poor run following their 1-1 draw against Fortune Sacco which was their third match without a win. Ojienda whose side registered the weekend’s biggest win, a 4-1 rout of Vihiga Bullets at Migori stadium, says the similarity of play between Bullets and Police gives them a head start as they eye to avenge the 2-1 loss they suffered in the first leg, at the hands of the law enforcers, at Kericho Green stadium. A win could move Shabana to within a point of Police, a feat that will augur well with their quest for a promotion berth. Speaking to Citizen Digital, Ojienda hinted that his team will attack from the first minute. “Today was arguably my best game in charge of Shabana, and I am glad the boys have worked on their concentration. “Police and Bullets have an identical playing style and we will tweak our game to ensure we collect maximum points.” Also Read: Vihiga Bullets head coach Milton Kidiga will hope his charges will overcome their latest setback in time to salvage their season. After a bright stint before the league was halted owing to the third wave of the Covid- 19 pandemic, Bullets have not tasted victory in five consecutive matches, a run that has seen them drop to fifth on the log. “We made costly mistakes against Shabana and that has been our undoing since the league restart. We will go back to the drawing board and rethink what needs to be done. Our objective at the moment is to earn our first win that can get our season back on track. To achieve that feat, they will have to maneuver through a tough run of fixtures that will see them play Fortune Sacco, Coast Stima, and Football Club Talanta in their next three fixtures.
