IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati says it will be almost impossible to carry out a boundaries delimitation exercise before next year’s General Election. According to the electoral commission boss, IEBC had scheduled to complete the exercise in 2024, raising doubts on the implementation of proposals in the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) driven constitutional changes, among them creation of 70 new constituencies. He spoke during an election preparedness session with the senate Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. Article 89 of the Constitution requires that IEBC reviews boundaries of electoral zones at intervals of not less than eight years and not more than 12 years. “The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission shall review the names and boundaries of constituencies at intervals of not less than eight years, and not more than twelve years, but any review shall be completed at least twelve months before a general election of members of Parliament,” reads the law. If a general election is to be held within twelve months after the completion of a review by the Commission, the new boundaries shall not take effect for purposes of that election.
