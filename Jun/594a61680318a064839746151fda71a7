Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) have arrested six more suspects in connection with the robberies targeting pedestrians and motorists on the Southern Bypass. The six are Messi Martha Mutioka, Tevin Njuguna, Edward Baraza Shikoba, Lawrence Gitahi Ndirangu, Kenneth Maina Chege and David Lugali Asianja, all aged between 21 and 32 years old. The sleuths, during the operation, also recovered 112 assorted mobile phones all suspected to have been stolen. One victim said to have been attacked previously by the gang has so far visited the Lang’ata Police Station and identified her phone, with officers now urging others to do so as well.
