A 40-year-old Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE) teacher was on Tuesday night shot dead by unknown people in Koyolo sub-location of Rangwe, Homa Bay County. Clinis Atieno Ojenge, an employee of the Homa Bay County government at the ECDE center in Gul Kagembe Primary School, was shot dead in her homestead and died on the spot. The gangsters reportedly raided her home at about 8.55 pm and found her washing utensils by the door and fired three bullets at her. The deceased’s nine-year-old daughter also suffered serious injuries during the attack after being hit on the stomach by a stray bullet. She was taken to Asumbi Mission Hospital before being transferred to the Kisii Level Five hospital where she is admitted. Homa Bay County government administrator in charge of Rangwe sub-county Amadi Simba said the thugs struck after the teacher had returned home from her work. Also Read: Simba condemned the killing and called on security officials in the area to investigate the matter and bring the culprits to book. The deceased’s mother-in-law Teresa Adera said the motive of the attack remains a mystery to them as Mrs. Ojenge did not have squabbles with anybody in the area. The area residents led by former councillor Peter Otieno have since threatened to hold a peaceful demonstration should the police fail to arrest the suspects soon. Homa Bay sub-county Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) Officer Monica Berege said a probe had already been launched into the killing.
