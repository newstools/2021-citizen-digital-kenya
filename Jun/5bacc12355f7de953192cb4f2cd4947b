Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has called for truce between ODM leader Raila Odinga and his Wiper Party counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka. Ngilu warned the clashing duo and their NASA co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetangula that they stand to lose their stab at the country’s top seat should each decide to go alone. Ngilu’s call comes in the wake of a heated war of words between Raila and Kalonzo over who should back the other for the 2022 presidential bid. “I won’t tire in telling them the truth. They are about to repeat the blunders we committed in the 1992 and 1997 general elections in which we lost to retired late president Daniel Moi. But we managed to defeat him after forging a united front in 2002,” she noted. Governor Ngilu expressed confidence that the four NASA leaders stood a better chance of sailing one of them into State House if they were united. She was speaking during the official launch of Ksh.180 million Kitui County Empowerment Fund at Kyuso Stadium in Mwingi North.

Without mincing his words, Kalonzo said he would be “the most stupid person on earth” to endorse Mr. Odinga, who was his co-principal in the National Super Alliance (NASA), for the third consecutive time. Odinga would later hit back at Kalonzo Musyoka saying in any case, he has not sought his support as far as the 2022 election is concerned, adding that he (Kalonzo) should relax and wait for the right time.
