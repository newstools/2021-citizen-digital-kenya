Former Chelsea and Inter Milan boss Antonio Conte has emerged as the clear front runner for the vacant Tottenham manager’s role. It is understood talks with the Italian have advanced quickly and there is now a growing expectation is he will replace Jose Mourinho as Tottenham manager. Spurs made contact with former boss Mauricio Pochettino last week but PSG have remained steadfast in their refusal to allow him to leave. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is unlikely to allow that situation to drag on too long with the club having been without a permanent manager since the departure of Mourinho on 19 April. Levy said the club had “lost sight of some key priorities” during construction of its new stadium and the Covid-19 pandemic. Spurs finished last season seventh in the table, qualifying for the new Europa Conference League.

Conte won the 2016-17 Premier League in his first season as Chelsea manager but was sacked at the end of the following season when he won the FA Cup but finished fifth in the league. The 51-year-old led Inter to the Europa League final in 2019-20 and within one point of Italian champions Juventus – who had finished 21 points ahead the season before. Inter claimed their 19th Scudetto with four games remaining last season, with their points tally of 91 ranking as the second highest in the club’s history. -Report by BBC Sport Video Of The Day: CAS Rachel Shebesh and athlete Asbel Kiprop share their mental health journeys
