The Ministry of Sports says Kurume City has not pulled out of hosting Kenya’s pre-Olympics training camp, contradicting an earlier statement released by the country’s Olympics committee. Nock announced yesterday that Kurume City had scrapped the plan over COVID-19 concerns with that communication sent out on Tuesday. Officials from the Japanese city said infections had spread rapidly in the area since mid-April creating a critical situation, with some facilities for training camps now turned into vaccination venues. But Sports CS Amina Mohamed said Nock’s announcement was not factual, reaffirming the travel schedule for Team Kenya to Kurume on 5th July, nearly three weeks before the Games are due to start in Tokyo. CS Amina @AMB_A_Mohammed has refuted claims of cancellation of Pre-Olympics Training Camp contract with Kurume City. She has reaffirmed the travel schedule for Team Kenya from the 5th July 2021 to Kurume for Pre-Olympics Training Camp. @JoeOkudo @SonoftheSoilOne @HonSKachapin pic.twitter.com/0WyfoFkEi9 — Ministry Of Sports, Culture & Heritage (@moscakenya) June 3, 2021 Also Read:  Kurume is set to host Kenya under full sponsorship for their stay, including accommodation, local travel in Japan, training venues and meals for the entire delegation. There was no immediate response from Nock. Much of Japan is under a state of emergency due to a third wave of COVID-19 infections, but Tokyo Olympic organisers have vowed to press ahead with the re-scheduled Games, which were postponed for a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
