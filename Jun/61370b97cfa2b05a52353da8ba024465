Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) have arrested three people suspected to have been involved in the kidnapping of a 79-year-old man in Kitale on June 6, 2021. The trio; Grace Kerubo Nyakundi, Samwel Atunya Makori and Richard Okari Matunda, were arrested on Tuesday night for allegedly kidnapping Kennedy Bosire Nyabwari. Nyabwari is said to have left his Kitale home for Kisii at around 5:30pm, called his wife at around 9pm to inform her that he would spend the night in Kitale town before proceeding to Kisii early the following morning. That was however the last his wife would hear from him as when she called him the following day at around 4pm, his phone went unanswered. At around 8:30pm, his wife said she received a call from strangers informing her that they had kidnapped her husband and were demanding a ransom of Ksh.2 million for his release. The terrified woman reported the matter to the DCI through their toll free line, upon which a team of sleuths based in Kitale began tracking down the suspects.
