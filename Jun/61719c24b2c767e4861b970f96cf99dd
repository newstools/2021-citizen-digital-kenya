Nicholas Kimeli stamped his authority over the 5000m race after edging Daniel Simiu for the pair to seal Tokyo Olympics slots while Samuel Chebole was a distant third. Kimeli who trains at the Global Sports Communication in Kaptagat clocked 13:02.88 to qualify for his maiden Olympics in Tokyo. “I want to thank my coach and training partners for their support until I have made the team. As I had promised during the semifinals, I was going for the ticket,” said Kimeli. With the world record holder Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda, two-time world champion Mukhtar Edris standing in his way to victory in Tokyo, Kimeli is unfazed with the fierce competition. “I have met with all of them especially in the Diamond League meetings. I am vowing today that I will work hard to ensure that I get to the podium if not win a gold medal,” said Kimeli. For Simiu who was locked out of the 2019 World Championships due to anti-doping rules, he is happy to once again make the team to Tokyo. “I have finally made it through God’s grace. It is now hard work as I prepare for the Games. I know we will work together with Kimeli to make sure we deliver something for Kenya,” said Simiu.
