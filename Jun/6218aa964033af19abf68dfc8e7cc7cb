AFC Leopards will treat every team with respect but will play without fear, head coach Patrick Aussems has said after qualifying for the FKF Cup round of16. Ingwe will face Bungoma Superstars on Sunday in the round of 16 thanks to their 1-0 win over Posta Rangers courtesy of Collins Shichenje’s goal. Superstars on the other hand thumped Nation FC 3-0 to set up the date. “I respect every team but we don’t fear anyone. So if I had to play against Bungoma, Real Madrid or Chelsea I will play with the same philosophy. We will respect this team because they have got to this stage by merit. “We know that we will have to take the game from the beginning in the right way and try to make the difference very quickly,” Aussems said. In the meantime, Rangers coach Stanley Okumbi has rued many chances his boys failed to convert saying that the outcome could have been different if they had been clinical. According to the former Harambee Stars head coach, his side remains ‘work in progress’ as they continue with what he alluded to as a rebuilding process.
