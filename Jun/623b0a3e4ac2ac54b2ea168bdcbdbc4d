National carrier Kenya Airways (KQ) is set to resume flights to London on June 26 after a new two months hiatus. The restart of the direct flights to Heathrow Airport follows the lifting of the suspension of flights to and from the United Kingdom by the government of Kenya. “The resumption of flights to London, United Kingdom is in line with our plans to grow and expand our routes as restrictions lift which will positively impact the flow of trade and tourism across the region by offering our customers convenient travel across the world. This route offers our customers convenient connections to key destinations,” said Julius Thairu, KQ’s Acting Chief Commercial and Customer Officer. “We remain fully committed to offer our customers an onboard travel experience that has their health and safety in mind.” Kenya and UK governments have developed new protocols anchoring the return of flights between the pair of countries. For instance, passengers travelling to the UK must be of British or Irish nationality or have official residency in the UK.
