The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in Thika West is seeking a woman for jumping bail in a case where she is accused of obtaining money by false pretence. Beatrice Gathoni Boro was arraigned at Thika Law Courts in 2017 and charged with defrauding a victim over Ksh.15 million in a food supply deal to a refugee camp in Kenya. She was later released on a Ksh.1 million bond but later absconded. A warrant of arrest has since been issued against her. The DCI is now asking members of the public with any information that may assist to her arrest to reach out.
