Gor Mahia captain Haron Shakava is confident his team will bounce back to winning ways after the weekend shock defeat to Western Stima when they tackle Bandari in Wednesday league duel at the Thika Stadium. Gor have been unbeaten since the resumption going on an eight-match winning streak but this was halted when they lost 2-1 to Western Stima on Saturday to deflate their quest for a ticket to the CAF Champions League. With the FKF Cup final set to take place on Sunday against their arch rivals AFC Leopards, Shakava is hoping a win against Bandari will be a good build towards the final. “Stima took their chances against us and scored. We can’t blame anyone for the loss. It was painful but we have to keep our heads and bounce back against Bandari on Wednesday. I know they have been struggling to get wins recently but the win on Saturday against Kariobangi Sharks who are a very tricky side show that they can be a very dangerous opponent, ”said Shakava. Bandari won their first league match since the resumption of the league on Saturday when they thrashed Kariobangi Sharks 4-1 at Mbaraki Stadium and the Gor captain says they are wary of the danger the Bandari attack can cause but they are determined to stop them.
