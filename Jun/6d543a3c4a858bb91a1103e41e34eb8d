Equity Hawks coach David Maina expects a gradual rise of his team in the Kenya Women Basketball Premier League, after a long period out of action following the Covid-19 break. The Hawks will be facing Storms and UON Dynamites this weekend and Maina is not over ambitious. “It’s been a while since we played our last league match, so I just hope the players will be able to adjust as the game progresses. However, our preparations have been good and we don’t have all players available for selection,” he said. Maina is chuffed at the preparations especially on the COVID-19 protocols front, as they wait for results after being screened for the virus. “Our players took their covid-19 tests on Friday and I hope the results will allow a full team for this weekend. I believe we are going to win both games, but we can’t predict how our opponents are due to the long absence,” he added. On his side, Storms head coach Abel Nson is lurking to stage an upset against the defending champions.
