AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia diehard fans are pleading with the government to re-open Nyayo and Kasarani stadiums to accommodate FKF matches as well as allow them to attend the games. The two largest stadiums have been under lock and key for football matches since the resumption of sports due to the coronavirus pandemic. The closures have meant Ruaraka and Utalii grounds have had to bear the brunt for being overused and the fans of the two clubs are now calling on the government to review the ban. The league matches have been ongoing since the lifting of the ban with the fans locked out but they want this reviewed too. “There has been shortage of stadiums in Nairobi yet we have a lot of teams in this City like eight of them. League matches have been a challenge due to venues and so we urge the government to open-up these stadiums. “If the government can allow 3,000 people to attend Madaraka Day celebrations in Kisumu, why not do the same in the FKF matches?” Edwin Ambeyi, a Leopards fan posed. Also Read: According to Gor diehard Jaro Soldier, if matches were to be played in either of the two facilities then social distancing would not be an issue, owing to their sizes of the facilities. “We are humbly pleading to the government to please allow these matches into Kasarani and Nyayo because it can never be an issue when we use Nyayo stadium with fans attending the matches. “If it is social distancing, in Nyayo even if we are many it can’t be a challenge for us to observe the protocols of the ministry of health”, Jaro Soldier said. Since the league restart, matches are played behind closed doors while the government continues to monitor the Covid-19 situation in the country. It remains unclear if fans would be allowed back to stadiums before the season ends. Video Of The Day: CAS Rachel Shebesh and athlete Asbel Kiprop share their mental health journeys
