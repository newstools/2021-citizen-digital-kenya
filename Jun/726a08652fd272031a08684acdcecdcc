Gor Mahia FC’s assistant coach Sammy Pamzo Omollo is wary of the attacking threat posed by Eric Kapaito when they play against Kariobangi Sharks on Thursday in the quarter-finals of the FKF Cup. Kapaito is the FKF Premier League top scorer with 14 goals and Pamzo says they must contain him but they will also look to capitalise on Sharks’ leaky defence. Sharks eliminated KCB 5-3 on penalties in the round of 16 while Gor defeated Mara Sugar 2-1 to set up the mouth-watering clash. “They can score goals if you give them an opportunity. They have a danger man who can capitalize on a mistake that you make. We have improve very well defensively in the recent matches so we are confident of controlling and threats that come our way. We know their defence hasn’t been at their best recently and that’s one area we plan to capitalize on during the game,” Pamzo said. The veteran tactician also raised doubts on the fitness of Titus Okello who got a knock during the weekend win but at the same time calmed the concerns insisting they still have options to score goals.
