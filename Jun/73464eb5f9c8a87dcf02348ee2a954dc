Two-time African champion Mathew Sawe is among 15 high jumpers who have qualified for the Olympics via World Rankings position after placing 24th in the world by end of the entry period. He will be making his debut at the Games after he was controversially axed from Team Kenya for Rio in the Summer of 2016, just a month after he had won his first African title. Sawe had already been named in the Kenyan team bound for Tokyo following the three-day Kenyan trials on June 19 at the Kasarani Stadium. The event will feature 32 athletes, with 16 having gone through after attaining the Tokyo standard of 2.33 metres and one more securing a slot by Universality places. They are scheduled to take place between 30 July and 1 August 2021 at the Japan National Stadium.
