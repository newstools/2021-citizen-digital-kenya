FKF Vice-President Doris Petra says she is looking forward to having a unified Kenya Women Premier League next season as opposed to the just concluded term where the league was split into two zones – A and B. Petra says this was occasioned by lack of sponsors and financial challenges that made them split the league and she believes if they get sponsors on board next season they will have a unified competition. “We want to trim down the league so that we have one league and that will depend on finances which we will discuss with the teams, because most of the financial burden is carried by the them. It is our wish to have one league so that at the end of the season we don’t have another competition like playoffs for merging the two zones,” Petra told Citizen Digital. Petra adds that had it not been for Covid-19 pandemic, they could have roped in a sponsor and is hopeful ahead of the new campaign. “If not for Covid-19 we could now be having a sponsor for the two national leagues but we hope to have a sponsor on board next season,” she said.
