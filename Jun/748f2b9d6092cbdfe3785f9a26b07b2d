The government has closed a Muslim secondary school in Sagana, Kirinyaga County, and sent over 100 students home in a fresh crackdown on unregistered institutions. Deputy County Commissioner Moses Ivuto said the director of the institution, Tahfidh-ul-Quran Academy Secondary School, was also arrested in the operation. Mr. Ivuto warned those operating without following directives from the Ministry of Education that the law would catch up to them. “Most of these institutions do not meet the minimum standards required and we will investigate this school director further,” said the Deputy County commissioner. Ndia sub-county Director of Education Kamemba Kamande said the school director will be arraigned in court and charged for operating an unregistered school, further for going against the government’s COVID-19 guidelines. The school boss is presently being held at the Baricho Police Station in Ndia, Kirinyaga West.
