The village elder Simon Maucha said the body of the deceased identified as Leonida Orimba had some injuries on the body, an indication that she was murdered and body dumped by unknown attackers. Mr. Maucha said their preliminary investigation indicates that the deceased was spotted at a nearby chang’aa den before her body was found dumped along the road.

The incident was confirmed by the area chief Christopher Owuo who said that the matter is under police investigation. One of the suspects narrated that the deceased went to his home late in the evening asking for chang’aa which she declined to give out because she was already drunk.
