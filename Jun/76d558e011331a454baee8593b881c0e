National 400m champion Mary Moraa has set her sights on having a successful show at her debut Olympic Games slated for Tokyo Japan from 23 July to 8 August 2021. Moraa who will team up with other Kenyan great Eunice Sum and Emily Cherotich in Kenya’s quest for gold in the 800m race says she has her work cut out ahead of the kick-off date, adding that she will work hard to get ready. “I’m  elated to have qualified because all along I made it very clear that was my priority and I consider it to be a positive step in my development. “I want to impress so I must prepare well to stand a chance against other best athletes that will participate.” Having successfully transitioned from 400m to 800m she sees making the cut for the quadrennial extravaganza as a worthy reward for the hard work she put in her preparation despite the numerous challenges occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The journey was not easy because we had to make do with the absence of crucial competitions that are important in the qualification process.” Also Read: “Also winning against a seasoned runner like Sum was not easy because I felt uneasy at the beginning but I won it at the end,” she added. A successful outing in Tokyo will set her on course to replicating memorable achievements by other Kenyan track greats like Pamela Jelimo who became the first Kenyan woman to clinch the 800m gold in the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and holds the national record. Moraa stormed into the global scene when she overcame a daunting men’s challenge to bag gold for Kenya in the 4x400m mixed relay at the 2017 World U-18 Championships that were held at the MISC Kasarani Stadium in Nairobi. Moraa also holds the World U-18 silver and is the Africa U-20 champion. Video Of The Day: KEMRI scientists examine safety of anti-malarial drugs in first trimester of pregnancy
