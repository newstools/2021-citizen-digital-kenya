Storms women basketball head coach Abel Nson says his team is well prepared for the weekend tournament dubbed the Basketball Battlefield (TBN) Queens‘ Edition. Nson says his aim is to win at the event that is being organized by the Africa Guarantee Fund in conjunction with the Kenya Basketball Federation. “I am feeling good about it and it’s a good opportunity to redeem ourselves from our last tournaments. We cannot organize, prepare and lose therefore we look forward to winning the tournament,” he said. The tournament organisers have set it up in adherence to the COVID-19 guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health with teams undergoing tests on Wednesday and yesterday. “We have done the Covid-19 testing best on the MOH guidelines and waiting for the results to know who are capable of playing,” he added. The event will be held at Nyayo Gymnasium and Strathmore University Grounds on tomorrow and will see six Premier League battle it out for the trophy. The six teams that have been invited for the tournament are Eagle Wings, Zetech, Storms, Strathmore, Equity Hawks and UON Dynamites. The tournament was supposed to be held on March 8 to celebrate International Women’s Day but was called off as the country was under lockdown at the time. Pool A, which has Eagle Wings, Zetech and Storms, will be played at Nyayo Gymnasium while Strathmore, Equity Hawks and UON Dynamites will face in Pool B at Strathmore Grounds. The top two teams from each group will advance to the semis with the tournament winner bagging Sh50,000. The runners-up will pocket Sh25,000 with Sh15,000 and Sh10,000 set aside for third and fourth placed finishers. The Most Valuable Player will be awarded with Sh5,000 while the highest scoring player and best defensive player will go home with Sh2,500 each.
