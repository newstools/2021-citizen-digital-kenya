Olympic 1500m champion Faith Kipyegon is set to renew her rivalry with world champion Sifan Hassan over the distance at the Golden Gala Pietro Mennea, the third leg of the Diamond League series set for Florence on June 10. The meeting has been moved from its traditional venue-Rome’s Stadio Olimpico which is set to host this summer’s European Championships in football that kicks off next week. Kipyegon will be returning to her specialty after a scintillating performance in 800m at Doha meeting where she clocked a season best of 1:58.26 while Hassan clocked 3:51.95 in the metric mile race. Also in the start list is the European champion Laura Muir of Britain.
