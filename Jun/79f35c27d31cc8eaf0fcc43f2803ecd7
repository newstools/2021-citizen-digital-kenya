National Super League side Shabana head coach Robert Ojienda expects his side to rise from last weekend’s shortcomings that saw them allow second-placed Kenya Police to score an equalizer with two minutes left to play. The FKF-PL promotion-chasing side, Shabana struck the opener through John Musyoka in the 16th minute and dominated the better part of the game but a lapse in the dying moments ensured the two sides shared spoils in a hotly contested affair at Camp Toyoyo on Saturday. While he is confident his side has what it takes to secure a promotion berth, Ojienda has warned his side needs to learn how to prevent conceding last-minute goals that have robbed them four points since he took over from then Interim coach Joseph Ongoro. “This match was tough since the two sides are separated by four points on the log. We started very well and am happy with the way my players expressed themselves. However, we must learn to close out games in such circumstances,” he noted. This was the second time the glamor boys had allowed in an equalizer with the first one being against Mully Children’s Family in his first game in charge that ended 2-2. Shabana will welcome Silibwet Leons FC on Wednesday with a win enough to propel them to number three on the log.
