Tax receipts in May grew by 36.4 per cent to Ksh.122.6 billion from a low Ksh.89.8 billion in May last year. This is according to data from the National Treasury statement of actual revenues and net exchequer issues across 11 months of the 2020/21 financial year to May 31, published on Friday. The growth in receipts marks a continued normalization of government revenues following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which struck collections in April last year. Cumulatively, tax receipts in 11 months now stand at Ksh.1.313 trillion, a similar level to the combined collections of Ksh.1.33 trillion at the same time last year. However, non-tax revenues registered a rare dip, shedding Ksh.459.3 million during the month to Ksh.80.6 billion. Combined, tax receipts and non-tax revenues make up ordinary revenue.

The tax man’s collections have been boosted this year by the gradual lifting of COVID-19 restriction measures including the adjustment of curfew hours. Nevertheless, the collections remain threatened by the potential return to tougher restriction measures as a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections beckon. The hit of the pandemic on collections saw the National Treasury revised KRA’s annual tax targets from a higher Ksh.1.568 trillion.
