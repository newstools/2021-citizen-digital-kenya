Kabras Sugar forwards coach Dominique Habimana expects the quality of rugby to drop ahead of the Kenya Cup resumption this weekend. The Western based side won’t be in action this weekend, taking their rest, and Habimana believes it will take the players time to get their best, maybe after three matches, owing to a long period without rugby. “The boys across the clubs will come back rusty but they’ll be back to their form very fast,” said Habimana. Habimana added that Kabras technical bench alongside backs coach Jerome Muller, and Edwin Achayo, are working to win both the league and the Enterprise Cup. “Kabras Sugar’s number one goal is to go for the trophy (Kenya Cup) and Enterprise Cup (if it will be played), so that’s what we’re working towards. Polishing our forwards, and Jerome working with the backs alongside Achayo, who’s working with the centres,” added Habimana. The former Kenya rugby 15s head coach said the players are keeping fit as they continue to put their act together so as to be able to challenge for the league. Also Read: At the same time Habimana believes that all the clubs should go back to their roots, and identify themselves with the communities, in order to get sponsors. “If you look at Thika Road, clubs like KCB RFC and Blak Blad are all community clubs with a lot of sponsors, with schools looking up to them, shifting from where a bunch of friends were having fun playing rugby,” said Habimana. “KCB, Harlequins, Impala, Top Fry Nakuru and Kabras are looking after several schools and universities since that’s the new level of demands on the club game which is attracting more sponsors,” explained Habimana. Kenya Cup resumes this weekend, after it was put on hold over the weekend for one more week, in honour of the late former Kenya Sevens coach Benjamin Ayimba.
