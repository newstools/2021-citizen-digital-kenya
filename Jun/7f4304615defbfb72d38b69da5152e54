Ferdinand Omanyala smashed the 100m national record when he ran an impressive 10.02 seconds to also attain Olympic qualification time which is set at 10.05 seconds. The nerve-wracking final that led to four false starts and disqualification of Uganda’s Orogot Tarsis, saw Omanyala finally beat Mark Otieno who also attained the Tokyo mark when he clocked 10.05 to finish runners up. ” It is finally a dream come true and especially to do it at home is something very special to me. I really thank the fans for the support the have given men. I am also happy we made the cut together with Mark,” said Omanyala. Despite losing his national record of 10.14 seconds and running with a hamstring concern, Otieno was nevertheless happy after securing Tokyo Games qualification. “It has been a real struggle but finally I made it and I thank God for that. I have really sought qualification both in Kenya, Africa and also in Switzerland only to qualify at the last minute,” said Otieno.
