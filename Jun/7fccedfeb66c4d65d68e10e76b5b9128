Nairobi City Stars can match any opponent in the Kenyan Premier League after half a season since their return, club CEO Patrick Korir has said. Fondly known as Simba wa Nairobi, City Stars were relegated from the top league in 2016, and after quite an odyssey to the prime stage again, there was no certainty of a good run at the start. City Stars have only lost to Gor Mahia from the time the league resumed last month, winning crucial matches against rivals Kariobangi Sharks and Sofapaka. They also knocked out Ulinzi Stars in the FKF Cup to qualify for the quarter finals of the tournament and will be facing Bidco United on Wednesday. “It’s the experience we have gained so far. When we were promoted to the league we retained most of the players we had in the National Super League so they struggled a little bit facing the experienced players in the league.  Since the resumption (after COVID-19 break) we have seen great improvement from them,”  said Korir Korir has meanwhile hailed former Gor Mahia striker Nicholas Kipkirui for adding the much needed mettle in their attack since joining in March. Also Read: “He is a great player and very experienced in the league from his time at Zoo Kericho. We jumped at the opportunity to sign him because we knew his potential to help the team overcome the scoring struggles,” added the club CEO. After Bidco United’s  in the Cup quarters, City Stars will host Western Stima in the league and Korir is hopeful they will overcome the fixture congestion facing them with the two competitions to juggle. “There are fitness concerns  because of fixture congestion and too much travelling within a short period between the games, but I’m hopeful our players are going to remain fit and give us the depth we need to rotate,” noted Korir.
