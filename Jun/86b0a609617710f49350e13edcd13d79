National 400m champion Mary Moraa has finally attained the Olympic qualifying standard in 800m just a few days before Kenya holds its trials for the Olympic Games. Moraa clocked a personal best of 1:59.25 to win the two-lap race at the Sollentuna Grand Prix, a World Continental Tour Bronze meeting held Sunday night in Sweden. Just a week ago, Moraa ran a personal best of 1:59.95 at the paavo Nurmi Games in Finland to fall only 45 microseconds shy of the Olympic qualifying standard set at 1:59.50 The 21-year-old who has enjoyed a fine form had also won at Kenya’s Olympics pre-trials held a fortnight ago where she chalked a personal best of 2:01.12 at the Nyayo Stadium. Moraa becomes the fourth Kenyan to secure qualification for Tokyo Games in 800m after former world champion Eunice Sum, Olympic 1,500m champion Faith Kipyegon and Emily Tuei. It is still unclear whether Kipyegon will compete in both 800m and 1500m which raises the possibility of the three athletes making the team.
