Gor Mahia head coach Carlos Vaz Pinto has been picked as the Premier League coach of the month for May. Pinto guided the defending champions to a one hundred percent record in the month, as they registered four wins in as many matches. Gor began the month with a hard fought 1-0 win over league returnees Nairobi City Stars at the Utalii grounds before humbling Sofapaka 2-1 at their backyard. The record champions narrowly edged Vihiga United 1-0 in their third match of the month played at the Mumias Sports Complex and replicated similar score line in the last encounter against Wazito at Utalii. Pinto beat KCB tactician Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno to the award with AFC Leopards coach Patrick Aussems closing the top three bracket. Zico who was decorated as the December coach of the month led KCB to collect seven points out of a possible 12 so is Aussems, but the bankers had better goal returns. The Portuguese becomes the fifth coach to be feted this season after Zico, Francis Kimanzi, Andre Casa Mbungo and Stanley Okumbi who were awarded in December, January, February and March respectively.
