A street preacher in Kithimani market, Machakos County, has received a severe beating after he made a second prophecy about deaths, thereby angering hawkers. The preacher first made a similar prophecy a while back during which he said that there would be an accident in the market that would lead to deaths. According to the hawkers, an accident indeed occurred in the market a couple of days ago that claimed the lives of two people. Hence, when the same preacher resurfaced on Thursday with a similar message, they rejected him. The hawkers are said to have descended on the preacher with blows before police officers came to his rescue.
