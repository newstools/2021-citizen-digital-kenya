Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai now says disciplinary action will be taken against any police officer found sharing official information on social media or the press without authority. IG Mutyambai, in a circular released on Wednesday, said police officers should not air their grievances externally without first going through the proper channels. The IG said he had noted the habit growing rapidly of late, adding that it is actually an offence in law. “The Inspector General has noted with a lot of concern that officers have developed a habit of using social media to advance their grievances without exhausting the laid down channels which include quality assurance/complaint and gender offices at service headquarters and the Internal Affairs Unit,” read the circular. “Chapter 24 Section 55 of the service standing orders prohibits information transmission by members of the service on social media unless they can clearly be linked to the conduct of official business. It is also an offence against discipline under Section 6(w) Chapter 30 of the SSO CMM to disclose or convey any information on police matters without proper authority.” IG Mutyambai further added: “Sharing of information with the media whether verbally or otherwise must be done in accordance with the regulations. Serious disciplinary action will be taken against any police officer(s) found abusing the use of social media and sharing information with the press without proper authority.” Also Read: Video Of The Day: CAS Rachel Shebesh and athlete Asbel Kiprop share their mental health journeys
