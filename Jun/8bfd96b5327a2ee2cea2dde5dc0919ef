Romelu Lukaku said he will remain at Inter Milan next season after the Belgium forward helped them to their first Serie A title in 11 years. Lukaku was named the league’s Most Valuable Player after bagging 24 goals and 11 assists, beating Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo to the award. The 28-year-old has a contract at Inter until June 2024 but has been linked with a move away from San Siro. The club are set to sell players as part of cost-cutting efforts to cope with the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Yes, I am staying,” Lukaku told broadcaster VTM. “I feel good at Inter.” “I’ve already had contact with the man who normally becomes our new manager,” Lukaku added. “Maybe I shouldn’t say that yet … but it was a very positive conversation. “There’s also the challenge of doing it again (winning the league).” Also Read: Italian media have reported Simone Inzaghi, who is set to leave Lazio when his contract expires at the end of the month, has agreed a two-year deal to coach Inter.
