Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum is close to joining Paris St-Germain on a free transfer. Wijnaldum opted not to sign an extension to his contract with Liverpool at the end of the season. It was anticipated the 30-year-old was going to join Barcelona when his Reds deal expires at the end of June. However, PSG, who finished second in Ligue 1 last season, are understood to have stepped in with a better offer and Wijnaldum has opted to join them. The presence of Mauricio Pochettino at PSG is also thought to have been a factor. Wijnaldum spoke highly of Pochettino before he joined Liverpool and although the deal is not completed, it is now anticipated the Dutchman will move to the French capital.
