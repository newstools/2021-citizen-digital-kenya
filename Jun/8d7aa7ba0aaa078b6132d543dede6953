Ugandan striker Sande Katumba has revealed it will be a dream come true to play for FKF Premier League side AFC Leopards in the near future. The 25-year old was pivotal to Equity FC’s impressive FKF Cup as the Division One side reached semi-finals, only to be knocked out by Leopards in a penalty shootout on Sunday. Katumba, who scored the lone goal in the quarterfinals against reigning champions Bandari, hopes Leopards have noted his qualities during the Cup ties. “It is has always been my dream to wear Leopards jersey and playing against them has given me more confidence to keep working hard and achieving my target,” said Katumba. He added, “Scoring against Bandari came at a good time and has awaken my confidence of aiming higher.” The Ugandan had earlier played in the topflight with Nairobi City Stars before it was relegated. The bankers have three matches in hand, in the Division One League and are currently third, 10 points behind leaders Naivas as the league enters its second leg this weekend. Their coach John Baraza said after bowing out of the Cup, they will be taking the lessons learnt while tackling the Premier League sides in their hunt for a slot in the National Super League next season. “The boys have learnt a lot and I think they will reciprocate the energy back in the league,” Baraza said. They lost to giants AFC Leopards through penalty shoot out in the first semi-final last weekend, thus shifting focus  on the league where they take on Ruiru Hotstars on Saturday away to Ruiru Stadium.
