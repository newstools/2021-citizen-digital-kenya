Despite registering two wins over the weekend, Sylvia Njeri, the head coach of women basketball premier league defending champions, Equity Hawks, believes they are yet to hit the much-needed momentum but she is happy with results picked. The Bankers hammered Eagle Wings and Storms 69-42 and 68-55 on Saturday and Sunday respectively. “I am happy for the performance over the weekend because we won our games but quite visibly you can’t stay out without playing for long. It has taken a toll on the team,” she said. At the same time, Njeri submits that the stoppage of the league every time lowers players’ form noting that the league should be allowed to run without interruptions. “We could do with playing a bit more regularly because if we keep on having these breaks, the forms of the players always go down. The weekend games were good and tough as you know game playing memories are gone but I am quite sure the next fixture we will be on top of our game,” she added. So far, the Hawks have played four games and won all of them as they look forward to defending the title they won last season. The competition has twice been halted owing to the ever changing face of the coronavirus.
