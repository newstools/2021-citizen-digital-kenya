Bungoma Superstars tactician Frank Musumba says his side is working steadily to earn a promotion to the country’s top league in a few years from now and the ambition cannot be stopped. The Bungoma based side put up a gallant fight against Premier League giants AFC Leopards on Sunday afternoon in FKF Cup despite bowing out of the tournament 4-2, and he believes the experience has catalyzed his boys to work themselves up. Second half goals from Robinson Kamura, Collins Shichenje, Isaac Kipyegon’s 78th minute penalty and Elvis Rupia’ strike guided the big cats through. “I am proud of my boys, despite covering 1,500km on the road in less than 6 days we put up a spirited fight, we lost but at least we showed the country that we are equally a good side. My boys have learnt a lot from the tournament. Our main target now is how we can get a promotion to the NSL and thereafter dine with the big boys, I want to assure our fans that we are working ourselves up there,” the League One side coach told Citizen Digital. Bungoma came into the match after a comfortable 3-0 win over Nation FC with AFC Leopards securing a 1-0 win over Posta Rangers.
