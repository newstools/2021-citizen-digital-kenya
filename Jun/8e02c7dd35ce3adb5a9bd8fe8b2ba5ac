Mully’s Children Family (MCF FC) coach David Maira has stated that they have attained their dream of retaining their slot in the National Super League and the goal is to go one step better next season all the way to the top tier league. MCF FC have had a dream debut season in the National Super League and have confirmed their place irrespective of how the results of their other matches go as they are currently third on the log with 32 points from 20 matches after beating Coast Stima 3-2 at Ruaraka grounds yesterday. Though there are 19 matches and 57 points still to play for, it would take a poor run of monumental proportion to see them drop to the relegation dogfight. Speaking after the win, Maira said that they will still aim to win more games as they challenge Talanta and Police FC who occupy the two promotion slots. “We came into the National Super League to survive relegation in our first season and we are almost achieving that so we want to aim higher now,” said delighted Maira. He added: “We are winning our matches and I think if we keep the winning, we will be thankful for a top tier slot next season.” Also Read: On his part, Coast Stima head coach Hussein Madaga has blamed fatigue for his team’s loss after they arrived from Mombasa on the matchday due to financial constraints. Stima had only 13 players in their contingent due to lack of sponsorship and injuries to the Mombasa based side. “We arrived in the morning and played in the afternoon. Of course, fatigue cost us but we keep pushing despite the problems,” expressed Madaga. Coast Stima was one of the three affected teams in the national leagues after state corporation Kenya Power withdrew their sponsorship due to Covid-19. Beside Coast Stima, another NSL side Nairobi Stima and FKF Premier League club Western Stima, have also been affected by the withdrawal of the sponsorship.
