According to data provided by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), 5,027,639 taxpayers had filed their returns by the close of June 29. This to surpass the number of filings made at the same time last year- 4,084,372. “The number is higher as a result of enhanced taxpayer sensitization on filing of tax returns and the measures put in place by KRA to facilitate taxpayers with the filing process,” KRA told Citizen Digital in response to queries on the filings.
