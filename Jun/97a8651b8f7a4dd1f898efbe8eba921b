Residents of Kibingoti area of Ndia in Kirinyaga County have lynched and buried a 28-year-old man who on Thursday hacked his mother to death and fled then came back to try and kill his brother. The suspect, Moses Gitau, was however not successful in his mission as he walked into an ambush by neighbours and was burnt to death. The angry neighbours who had all along been on the lookout for him, then buried him. Police officers exhumed the suspect’s body on Saturday morning and took it to the Kerugoya hospital morgue. According to Kibingoti residents, the suspect fled after killing his mother on Thursday night and they had no option but to lynch him. This, they said, was because relatives said they were living in fear since the suspect killed their 58-year-old mother Tabitha Muringo Mwai before showing up at home on Wednesday evening carrying red ribbons commonly used in funerals. “Huyo mama tumemjua kwa muda mrefu, alikuwa na bidii kujifanyia kazi na kulea watoto wake,” said one of the area residents. “Alikuwa anataka kuua ndugu yake…alikuwa anamnyonga, huyo ndugu yake akapata nguvu akapiga nduri watu wakakuja wakamsaidia,” stated another.
