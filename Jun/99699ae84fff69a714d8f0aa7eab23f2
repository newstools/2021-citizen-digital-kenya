The Kenya hockey premier league is likely to kick off next month according to the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) president Nahashion Randiek. The league which has not been in action since the outbreak of coronavirus in Kenya last year was set to resume in April only for sporting activities to be suspended again due to the surge of infections in the country. According to Randiek the union is ready for league take off under strict observance of existing government Covid-19 protocols. “We had already set up everything for our league to resume but it was unfortunate that the moment we were ready to start then the impossible happened,” Randiek told Citizen Digital. The union had previously disclosed that only the top flight league would resume as the Super Leageue and Nationwide League competitions remain suspended. “We are working on that (resumption) and maybe in a months’ time we should be ready to go. You know we must give the clubs at least a month to prepare before we start,” said Rachier.
