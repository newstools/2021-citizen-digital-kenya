Education Cabinet Secretary Prof. George Magoha has ordered school heads across the country to ensure parents pay school fees for the 3rd Term. Speaking at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) during the handing over of the multi-million Agricultural Laboratory (ALB) building which was funded by the Japanese International Corporation Agency (JICA), Magoha noted that some parents from well off families were taking advantage of an earlier directive on the payment of school fees during the COVID 19 pandemic. “I want to request, on behalf of government, that the Kenyan parents who are still denying paying the balance of their third term school fees to pay without delay,” said Magoha. He added: “The headteachers and principals should double-check and ensure that the child they are sending home is not from a poor family or where the parent has lost their job. Majority of people who are refusing to pay school fees can afford to pay and they must now pay.” CS Magoha also announced that the Form 1 selection process is on course and will be complete in 2 weeks times as more than 1 million learners will get placements across various secondary schools in the country. The government has also disbursed 9.3 billion shillings across all learning institutions in the country.
