National carrier Kenya Airways (KQ) has expanded its code-share agreement with the US Delta Airlines opening up new destinations for the local airline. Through its direct New York flights, KQ is expected to connect to Delta’s services to Washington offering access to the US Capital and the city of Indianapolis. On their part, Delta customers will connect to more African cities under the code-share including Monrovia, Freetown, Harare and Kigali. The expanded agreement takes the pair’s code-share network to a combined 39 cities across Africa, the US and Canada. “Kenya Airways and Delta Air Lines’ partnership remains central to our plans of offering the fastest connections to the Americas from our Nairobi hub and is in-line with our brand promise of enabling the sustainable development of Africa by providing access to different markets,” said Julius Thairu, Kenya Airways Chief Customer and Commercial Officer. Other destinations for KQ within the code-share cover Chicago, Colorado, Orlando, Florida, Raleigh Durham, Phoenix and Charlotte.
