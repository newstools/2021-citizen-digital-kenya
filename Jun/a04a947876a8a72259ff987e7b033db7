Toyota Kenya Sales and Product Trainer Sukhju Singh Kular (representing Managing Director, Arvinder Reel) said: “It’s truly an honor to be a part of the iconic WRC Safari Rally. Toyota has been an avid supporter of Safari over the years and for this year, we are giving some of our best cars as safety vehicles. The car has more power, more torque (500nm) and better efficiency.” Kimathi thanked Toyota Kenya and Toyota Gazoo Racing of Japan for their unswerving support towards Safari, which is returning to the global arena after a long hiatus. “I wish to thank Toyota Kenya and Toyota Gazoo Racing for donating the 000, 00 and the replica of the Yaris WRC car being given as a huge sponsorship to WRC Safari Rally. The three cars will help us immensely in the running of the event. I’m happy that Toyota has visited us to present the cars with just 12 days left to the start of this iconic event. With such generous support we want to deliver a great event,” Kimathi said.
