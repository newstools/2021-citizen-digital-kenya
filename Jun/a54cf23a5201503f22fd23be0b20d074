The hearing of a fraud case against Garissa Governor Ali Korane has been postponed to July 28 after one of the witness was stood down. This is after the court realised that the defence did not have all the documents the prosecution is relying on to prosecute the case against the Governor and his co-accused. In the case, Governor Korane and four members of his administration have been charged with suspicion of committing economic crimes. The accused are alleged to have embezzled a grant of Ksh.233.5 million issued to the county by the World Bank for the Financial Year 2018/2019. The grant, under the Kenya Urban Support Programme, was to be used to construct Qorahey market, re-carpet Garissa township roads and put up storm water drainage and pedestrian walkways. Victor Onyango Ogutu the first witness told the court that 45 counties were to benefit from the program under World Bank.
