Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum will join Paris St Germain from Premier League side Liverpool on a three-year deal, the French Ligue 1 side announced on Thursday. The 30-year-old made 237 appearances and scored 22 goals for Liverpool in all competitions, lifting the Premier League, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup titles with them. “Signing for PSG is a new challenge for me. I’m joining one of the best squads in Europe and I want to bring all my desire and commitment to this ambitious project. “PSG have proved how good they are in recent years and I’m convinced that together, with our supporters, we can go even further and higher,” Wijnaldum told the club’s website. A star-studded PSG team finished second to Lille in Ligue 1 last season and are looking to bolster their ranks to mount a fresh challenge. The versatile Wijnaldum signed for Liverpool from fellow Premier League side Newcastle United for Sh3.5 billion in 2016 and was a key figure in the Anfield side’s domestic and European successes.
