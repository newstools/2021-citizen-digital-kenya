Major League Soccer and Liga MX will continue to integrate and are on a path that could see them ultimately merge into one North American league, officials told Reuters on Wednesday. FIFA president Gianni Infantino recently said he would support such a move and added that it could produce the best league in the world, a sentiment shared by MLS Commissioner Don Garber and LIGA MX Executive President Mikel Arriola. “Working together, we can become one of the strongest regions in the world,” Arriola said in an interview. “We are aligned in the concept.” Garber said a merger would help tilt the soccer landscape in North America’s direction and give the region greater political sway at FIFA and CONCACAF. “Together, the combined forces of both leagues is going to be far more valuable to our fans and everyone who cares about our sport than if we were to try to go it alone,” Garber said.
