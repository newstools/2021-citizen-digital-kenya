Fresh from securing his ticket for the Tokyo Olympics, Kenyan sprinter Ferdinand Omanyala has declared the best is yet to come with his eyes set for a podium finish in his debut Summer Games. The newly crowned fastest sprinter  in Kenya (10.02) pulled a blistering speed in the final of the 100m during the national trials held on Thursday at the Moi Kasarani Stadium – Nairobi. “The best is yet to come. My focus in the Olympics is scooping a podium finish for the first time for my country. It calls for total focus and I’m ready to give my all for it,” told Citizen Digital. Omanyala, who outsprinted his rival Mark Otieno (10.05) as the duo secured Olympic tickets, is encouraged to have broken the 100m national record at home, the 10.14 set in 2017 just ahead of the Tokyo Games. He already knows what to improve on in the remaining four weeks before the global extravaganza, to ensure he records a faster time. “I’ve always wanted to change the notion that Kenyans can’t sprint, and I’m glad we have showing that. I need to work to foul starts and how I run in the first 50m, which are my areas of weakness as areas ahead of the Olympics,” Omanyala added.

We are hopeful all Work to the plan,” Omanyala said. The new set time saw Omanyala surpass the Tokyo Olympic Games qualifying mark of 10.05 and elevated him to new heights with the sprinter now ranked among the top 10 sprinters of the distance, at ninth in the world. Omanyala hunger for sub-10.00 seconds remains clear considering the world record is 9.58 seconds, set by Jamaican legend Usain Bolt in the 2009 IAFF World Championship.
