Ulinzi Warriors head coach William Balozi says his side is ready for the Kenya Basketball Federation league resumption over the weekend, over two months since it was stopped. The defending champions have an away trip to University of Nairobi’s Terror on Sunday and Balozi admits he is wary of their opponent’s home court advantage. “It will be a great game because all of us were on break and since we are starting with a team that is using their own court, we must be at our best,” Balozi said. At the same time Balozi says as a team they have done enough training over the past two weeks and they are ready for the match. “We started to train for the last two weeks and I believe my boys are in good shape and ready for the match,” he added. Meanwhile Strathmore’s Blades basketball team head coach Tony Ochieng says his team is in good condition and that they have been working on conditioning and tactics over the past two weeks as they prepare to resume the league over the weekend.
