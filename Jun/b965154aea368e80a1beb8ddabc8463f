A Murray Girls Form One student was killed in a terrible road accident in Tsavo on Monday evening. The student was in the company of several others who were travelling back to school after their mid-term break aboard a 14-seater matatu. Taveta Police Commander Charles Baraza confirmed the incident, saying that the accident occurred when the matatu driver swerved sharply to avoid hitting an elephant. In the moments that followed, the matatu lost control and rolled off the Taveta-Voi road before coming to a stop on the opposite side. According to the police chief, the Form One student died as she was being rushed to the Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi. Three other students sustained serious injuries and were rushed to the Coast General Hospital for specialized treatment.
