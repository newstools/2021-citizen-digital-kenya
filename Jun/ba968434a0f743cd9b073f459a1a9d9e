Kenya has raised Ksh.107.8 billion ($1 billion) from the international capital markets marking its fourth Eurobond issue in seven years. The new Eurobond issue which follows a three-day virtual investor roadshow has a tenure of 12 years, meaning it will mature in 2034. The bond was four times over-subscribed with investors putting in offers of Ksh.582.1 billion ($5.4 billion). Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani says the high subscription rate by investors mirrors strong confidence in the Kenyan economy even as he expects the new funding to anchor the country’s pandemic response. “The overwhelming response from global investors, reflects the market’s continued confidence in Kenya’s Economic Recovery Program supported by the IMF and is in line with our Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy approved by Parliament. We want to thank investors for their strong participation in the bond issuance,” he said. The pricing of the bond is expected to be completed later on Friday with sources indicating yields are likely to average around 6.3 per cent.
