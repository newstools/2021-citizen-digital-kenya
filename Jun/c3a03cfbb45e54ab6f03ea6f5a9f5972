Deputy President William Ruto has dismissed talks of a possible coalition between Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga and his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka. DP Ruto, who spoke on Saturday, said if the unity is made with the sole purpose of beating him in the next polls then its priorities are misplaced. According to the deputy president, political pacts should be made with agendas affecting the common mwananchi in mind. “Ati wanataka kuungana ndio washinde Ruto, mimi nataka niwaambie watafute sera ya mipango ya maendeleo wauze kwa wananchi. Kuungana kushinda mtu haiwezia saidia mtu yeyote, waungane watafute kwanza sera,” said Ruto. “They must first have an agenda for Kenya, you cannot just unite merely because you want to defeat somebody, na msipomshinda? Kenya hii si ya wanasiasa pekee yao, Kenya si ya viongozi pekee yao, Kenya ni ya Wakenya wote.”  Also Read: Opposition leader Raila hinted at collaborating with his former running mate Kalonzo in a bid for the country’s top job in 2022. Raila, speaking at the burial of former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile, said he will work with the Wiper party boss to ensure Kenya’s leadership transitions into the right hands. “Mimi na Kalonzo hatuwezi kosana,” he said. “Mimi na Kalonzo tutashikana tutoe hawa wezi, fisi waliovalia ngozi ya kondoo.” Raila accused several shadowy leaders of stealing from the public coffers and slowing Kenya’s development during a ceremony dominated by politics. “It is not that we do not pay tax, it is not like Kenya does not have enough revenue, its only that a few people in leadership positions steal the money,” he said.
