Umoja chairman George Gacheru Kago is confident his side will be ready for their 3rd July return deadline having not been part of the teams that returned to league action last weekend. After much wait the Kenya Basketball Federation got action back with some of the clubs among them Umoja failing to feature. Kago says the team requested to be excused from participating in the league for an extra three weeks as they put their house in order in readiness for an extended season that will be played under bubble conditions. He is adamant his outfit will be ready to carry on with their bright start before the break that was necessitated by the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Participating in the league is costly more so when we are required to conduct ourselves in strict accordance with the COVID-19 protocols. “We are taking some time out to source for the necessary resources that will facilitate our activities in the league,” he told Citizen Digital.

He says many of his players are not match-sharp after a long time out but is convinced they will stage a better show when they take on Emyba next weekend. “Many of my players struggle a little bit but I’m happy we scrapped a win and that is what matters. “Emyba area good side and we cannot win against them if we are not razor-sharp,” he warned. He has also welcomed the prospect of a reduced postseason in which the best four sides will make the cut for the playoffs. In other matches played over the weekend, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology defeated Safe Spaces 40-39 while Africa Nazarene University held on to floor Kenyatta University Oryx by a basket thanks to a 50-47 scoreline.
