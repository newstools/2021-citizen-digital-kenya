A Class Three pupil was reportedly defiled and murdered before her body was dumped in the Cheymen river in Londiani, Kericho County. Cheymen sub-location Assistant Chief Samwel Koech said the body of the pupil was discovered floating in the water covered with wood by estate workers who were plucking tea. He said the girl is suspected to have been lured out of the Cheymen estate camp on Tuesday evening after arriving home from school. Koech revealed that the assailant(s) defiled the girl before stabbing her on the left side of the chest and then throwing her body into the water. He said there were signs of struggle on the scene of crime, showing that the minor might have attempted to defend herself. The administrator said the girl took a long time to arrive home, hence her parents became suspicious and started inquiring about her whereabouts within the estate but she could not be traced. They then reported her missing at the Chagaik Police Post.

The body has since been taken to the Kericho sub-county hospital mortuary. Koech appealed to parents to be vigilant and monitor their children carefully and not to let them go to the river or forest without the company of relatives or friends.
