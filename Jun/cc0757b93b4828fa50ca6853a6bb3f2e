A Nairobi court has allowed the hearing of a case against former Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa to be heard in camera. This is after the prosecution asked the court to allow two witnesses from Defence Ministry to testify in private. “Since there are no objections… the witnesses who shall be called will testify in camera…,” the court ruled. In the case involving a fake military arms tender, Echesa and four others have been charged with criminal offences. Echesa pleaded not guilty to 12 fraud-related charges relating to the Ksh.39.5 billion fake arms tender. They are out on bail.
