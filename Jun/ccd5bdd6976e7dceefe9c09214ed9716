Fear and apprehension have engulfed Karambaini village in Limuru after the body of an 81-year-old woman known to locals as Margaret Ngina was discovered dumped in a cow pen. The deceased lived alone, according to neighbors, but had employed a farm-hand who is now considered the main suspect in the cold-blooded killing. Limuru deputy police commander Anthony Gitonga confirmed the incident and said an investigation was underway. According to neighbor accounts, the deceased had already informed her farmhand that his services were no longer required. The two were said to have clashed after the suspect was implicated in several robberies in the village. On Wednesday, several items believed to have been stolen from the decedent’s home were discovered at the suspect’s house.
