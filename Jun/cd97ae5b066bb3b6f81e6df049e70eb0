AFC Leopards Chairman Dan Shikanda is lamenting over the unavailability of Nyayo and MISC Kasarani stadia for the FKF Premier League matches. According to the former Leopards and Gor Mahia player, this has forced the club to opt for sub-standard Ruaraka grounds or the far-flung Mumias Sports Complex, for their home matches. Currently, no FKF match is allowed at Nyayo and Kasarani stadiums, with the latter being readied for the World Under-20 Athletics Championships set for August, leaving Leopards with no choice but to honour their matches at the home venue of Tusker FC. “The only options we have is either to use Ruaraka, Mumias, Narok or Utalii but the Utalii management has denied us access. So the only option we remain with is to opt for Ruaraka or Mumias and for your information, taking a team to Mumias cost us over Sh400,000. Where is the money to go to Mumias if we have not even paid players?” Shikanda asked, adding that, “That kind of money is better used in paying our players rather than travelling to Mumias for our home matches.” Also Read: After a disappointing 0-1 loss to Bidco United on Sunday at Ruaraka, the Leopards boss has called for calm and focus as they seek to earn their first CAF Champions League ticket since 1998 with a top finish by June 30th. “Let’s just focus and play because this is football with a winner and a loser. Let us prepare our matches and play. If there is no stadium of choice then we will just play anywhere…,”said Shikanda. The Sunday outcome saw Leopards drop to third with 36 points, same as second placed KCB who have a better goal difference while Tusker sit atop the standings with 38 points, after mauling Vihiga United 4-0 in Mumias.
