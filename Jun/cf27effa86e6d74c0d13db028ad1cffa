The body of a 73-year-old man was on Friday exhumed from a farm in Nyeri belonging to a woman who claimed to have lived with him for 16 years as his wife. The family of Hudson Wanjohi had obtained a court order that allowed the exhumation of the body of their kin barely a month after his burial. Residents of Kagongo village walked in to the home where they had walked barely a month ago to lay to rest a man who had lived there for 16 years, only that now they were witnessing the reversal of that process. “Hapa kulikuwa na mazishi mwezi mmoja uliopita, lakini huyo mzee akakufa, mama akamzika na walikuwa wamekaa na yeye miaka 16 lakini alikuwa na familia yake huyo mzee,” said his neighbour Francis Muchemi. And it is this burial that is the bone of contention with the family of the deceased saying they were not aware of the marriage between Wanjohi and Muthoni on whose land he is buried adding that they were never involved in burial plans. “I don’t know her, I have never met her, we were never involved in dowry, we only hear stories that he is married in a family here, and this land where he is buried does not belong to any of our family and we have land and the deceased had land where he could be buried,” said Samuel Ndumia, brother to the deceased.

The body now lies at the Mathari hospital morgue awaiting post-mortem to establish the circumstances around his death and a fresh burial date.
