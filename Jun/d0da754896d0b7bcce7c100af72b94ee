Two Al-Shabaab suspects have been killed in a security operation in Boni Forest, Lamu County. Confirming the incident, Lamu County Commissioner Irungu Macharia said the two were found with rifles loaded with ammunition. Macharia said the duo was gunned down by a special team of the police service conducting an operation to flush out Al-Shabaab militants within the forest. Boni Forest, which sits on the border of Kenya and Somalia, has been identified as a key hideout for Al-Shabaab militants from where they plan their terrorist activities and attacks on local security officers. Macharia said the operation to flush them out of their sleeper cell will continue, further urging nearby area residents to keep an eye out and inform authorities of any suspicious individuals.
