Argentina’s Lionel Messi has yet to agree on a new contract with Barcelona, the club where he has spent his entire career, and his 21-year association with the Catalans could come to an end at midnight on Wednesday if no new deal is reached. Barca’s all-time top scorer, who joined as a 13-year-old in September 2000, could stay beyond June 30 as a free agent, however, and officially not belong to the club until he puts pen to paper on a contract extension. The club declined to comment on Messi’s contract situation when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. Failure to tie Messi to a deal before June 30 would be an embarrassment for Barca and president Joan Laporta while further highlighting the club’s precarious financial situation. The club has a total debt of more than 128 billion shillings, while Messi’s soon-to-expire contract, which he signed in 2017, is the most lucrative in world sport, according to a January report in newspaper El Mundo. Laporta said this month that Messi, who tried to leave the club last year after falling out with previous chief Josep Maria Bartomeu, was keen to stay but also urged his captain to sign as soon as possible.
