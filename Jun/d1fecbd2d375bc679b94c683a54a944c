The titanic clash between league leaders Tusker and third placed AFC Leopards in the FKF Cup quarter final scheduled tomorrow at Utalii Grounds is definitely another final, according to Leopards assistant coach Tom Juma. The former Ingwe legend is of the opinion that no team is in the Cup as pushovers terming the weekend’s round of 16 game against Bungoma Superstars as one of their toughest outings this season. “All the matches have been hard, in fact there has not been a harder game than the one we played Bungoma Superstars FC in the Round of 16. Therefore, every match in this competition is a final because if you lose then you are out. We have so far managed to go past three of them and now another final awaits us tomorrow,” Juma said. Leopards are sweating over a number of minor injuries picked by Marvin Nabwire and Collins Shichenje with the duo being monitored closely while the Congolese Fabrice Mugheni midfielder Fabrice Mugheni being ruled out due to a knee injury. “We have a lot of injuries because of the many matches we are playing in a very short time. We lost Fabrice Mugheni to a knee injury while others like Marvin (Nabwire) and Shichenje (Collins) have minor injuries which we are monitoring to know whether they will be available against Tusker or not,” the former Harambee Stars ace added. Juma has called upon the playing unit to be more focused mistakes as the competition advances into the last eight stage.
