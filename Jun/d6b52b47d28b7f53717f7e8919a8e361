World 1500m champion Timothy Cheruiyot has revealed that he is 95 per cent fit ahead of Kenya’s Olympic trials set for June 17-19 at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. Cheruiyot who has been battling a niggling injury since last year said he is happy with his progress as he eyes a slot in Kenya’s team for the Summer Games. “I am getting better each day and I hope to return to full fitness soon. Remember it is an injury I have been battling since last year when I competed at the Doha Diamond League,” said Cheruiyot. Cheruiyot, the three-time Diamond League winner said he is ready to represent Kenya at the Tokyo Games as he targets his maiden Olympic medal. Despite being the clear favourite both at Kenyan trials and at the Olympics, the 25 year old is not taking any chances. “My focus is solely on the Olympic trials as I want to be part of team Kenya. I am however aware of the intensity of Kenyan trials it will not be that easy I will have to do my best,” said Cheruiyot.
