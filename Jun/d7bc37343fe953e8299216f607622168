The hotel industry in Naivasha has received a massive boost from local tourists who arrived for the World Rally Championships (WRC) Safari Rally Kenya. According to Bella safaris CEO George Njuguna, hotels in Naivasha, Nakuru and Elementaita have reported 100% bookings. “The hotels are reporting good business with many of most of them being booked to capacity,” said Mr. Njuguna. He further pointed out that open grounds have been converted to camping sites by rally fans following the lack of accommodation in hotels. The organisers say at least 10,000 people from all over the world are expected to attend the event anticipated to inject Ksh.6 billion into the economy. The event comes as a major boost to the tourism sector that is reeling from the COVID-19 disruption that has seen a sharp decline in international visitors as countries retain tough cross-border restrictions.
