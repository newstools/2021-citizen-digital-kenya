Kabras Sugar captain Dan Sikuta says they’re ready for the resumption of the Kenya Cup on 12th June following a protracted stoppage over COVID-19 challenges. The Shujaa and Simba lock said they’ve been training indoors in adherence to government regulations meant to help slow Covid-19 infections. “We had a long break but since the resumption of sports activities we’ve been training indoors observing the government protocols. “We’ve been polishing places where we were not strong enough before the President’s announcement to stop sports and for us we will pick from where we left with our target being winning the league,” Sikuta said. Sikuta added he expects all teams to resume the league, quoting the previous restart where some teams failed to resume saying they were not well prepared. “Every club has its managerial structure and it also depends on how the club has organised itself and for us as Kabras we are ready for the league and I hope the other clubs also are ready for the game,” he said.
