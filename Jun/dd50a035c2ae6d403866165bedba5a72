Kenya will be receiving 358,000 doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine from Denmark, the Ministry of Health has said. The consignment is expected to arrive in the country around 9 p.m. on Monday night. The doses arrive just days after concerns were raised about a shortage of COVID-19 vaccines to be distributed as second doses to healthcare workers and other frontline workers. The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists, and Dentists Union (KMPDU) had raised concerns, despite the Ministry of Health’s request for patience. Kenya started immunizing its people in March after receiving 1 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine from India. In May, the country was set to start the second phase of immunization. However, India, which is dealing with a massive outbreak of COVID-19, barred vaccine exports to vaccinate its population first.
