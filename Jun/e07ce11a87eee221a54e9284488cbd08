Vihiga Queens forward Terry Engesha is the Kenya Footballers Welfare Association (KEFWA) Player of the Month for March 2021, in the Kenya Women Premier League (KWPL) Zone B. In March, Engesha netted two goals against SEP Oyugis, two against Oserian and one against Wadadia, where she also had one assist. She was voted by her fellow players in Zone B as March’s best, attributing the recognition to the teamwork in her club. “I would like to thank my teammates since without them I cannot win any award,” said Engesha during a brief ceremony at Kidundu Grounds on Thursday. Vihiga Queens coach Alex Alumira lauded the youngster who also tops the KWPL goal scorers’ chart with 15 in 12 matches. “This award will motivate players and this improves the quality of our women football. It also shows we are doing something positive since Engesha was voted for by players from other teams. The more motivation there is, the better a team becomes,” said Alumira.
