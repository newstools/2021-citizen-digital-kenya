AFC Leopards head coach Patrick Aussems has kept his faith in Isaac Kipyegon as the club’s new captain and refused to explain why Robinson Kamura was stripped off of it. Kamura had been the Leopards captain since 2018 but has not worn the armband since March following an incident in which he was accused of sabotage in a wage row with the club. “It is a question I see as useless because Kip was on the pitch, he is captain, Kamura was on the pitch last week, was he captain or not? No he wasn’t,” Aussems said. In the absence of Kipyegon, Elvis Rupia and goalkeeper Benjamin Ochan have been preferred to take over leadership roles on the field. Ingwe stormed to the FKF Cup semis on Wednesday after edging Tusker FC 1-0 thanks to Kipyegon’s goal from the penalty spot. They will face Equity FC in Saturday’s semis. “We take game after game, right now you know we are in the semi-final which has no meaning and is useless if you reach the final and you win nothing,” Aussems said.
