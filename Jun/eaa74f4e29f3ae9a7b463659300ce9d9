Vihiga Queens head coach Alex Alumira is hoping they can continue their fine streak in the Kenyan Women Premier League (KWPL) when they host Trans Nzoia Falcons over the weekend. The league leaders thrashed Kisumu All Starlets 3-0 last Sunday to take their points tally to 37 from the opening 13 rounds and Alumira says the team is in no mood to slow down. “I can say we have improved a lot since our last match against Nakuru Queens. There were some lapses especially in our defence and striking departments but I am happy with the improvements. “Falcons are hard to beat and are currently in the top four which means they are a quality team,” Alumira told Citizen Digital. Commenting on their preparedness for the inaugural CAF Women’s Champions’ League tournament, Alumira said the league matches have assisted them to keep fit although he lamented the lack of proper training facilities. “Having the golden opportunity of representing Kenya in the East Africa region playoffs ahead of the CAF Champions League, we will have to bolster our training as well as squad.
