Manchester City face a fight to sign 15-billion-shilling-rated Jack Grealish – with Aston Villa determined to keep their captain after opening talks on a new contract. City manager Pep Guardiola is an admirer of the 25-year-old England midfielder who signed a new five-year deal with Villa in September last year. It is anticipated City will make a concerted attempt to sign Grealish this summer as part of an ambitious transfer plan which includes serious interest in England captain Harry Kane. He is currently with England preparing for their last 16 Euro 2020 game against Germany at Wembley on Tuesday, having started his first game of the tournament in last week’s 1-0 win over the Czech Republic. The playmaker, who has been with his hometown club since the age of six, made his senior Villa debut in 2014. Earlier his week, City had taken the first steps towards trying to sign striker Kane from Tottenham.
