Ethiopia’s Letensebet Gidey smashed the women’s 10,000m world record when she ran 29:01.03 during the Ethiopian trials for Tokyo Olympics held Tuesday in Hengelo, the Netherlands. Gidey’s new mark erases five seconds off the record of 29:06.82 set by Sifan Hassan at the same venue on Sunday. The 23 year old also holds a world record of 14:06.62 in 5000m and won a silver medal in 10,000m at the 2019 Doha World Championships. Gidey becomes the first woman to hold both the 5000m and 10,000m world records since Ingrid Kristiansen did so from 1986-1993. “I expected to run a world record. I’d like to try to break the world record again and break 29 minutes,” said Gidey who followed the blue lights of the wavelight technology that was moving at a world record pace. Tsigie Gebreselama came through to take second place in 30:06.01 as Tsehay Gemechu placed third in 30:19.29.
