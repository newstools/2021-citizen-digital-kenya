Titus Ekiru has revealed that he ran the Milan marathon with an injury on his patella after undergoing surgery last year. Ekiru won the Generali Milan Marathon on May 16 in a course record and world leading time of 2:02:57 with second placed Reuben Kipyego 58 seconds adrift. His time improved the course record he set in 2019 of 2:04:46 by 1 minute 49 seconds, as he became the joint fifth fastest marathoner of all time. “I was not worried about the injury I was determined to show the world that no human is limited ,it’s not an easy thing to do but when you are focused on the title you forget the risks and press on that is exactly what I did and I saw the fruit,” Ekiru said. Despite not being part of  this year’s Olympic marathon team said he is confident Ekiru is confident Kenya will get a gold medal in the race . “That is a great line up that will deliver gold they are hard working and very disciplined an sure anyone in that group will deliver gold for the country,” the marathoner added.
