Belgian driver Thierry Neuville has taken charge of the WRC Safari Rally standings after securing victories at Chui Lodge1 (SS2) and Kedong1 (SS3) this morning. Neuville leads with 16:52.3, holding a +8.2 advantage over Toyota Racing’s Kalle Rovanperä with Ott Tänak (+9.5) completing the top three places. The Belgian said he felt he could have gone faster but played cautious to preserve his rim. “In the beginning I thought I could have been faster but I was really afraid I could put out the tire rim. I think it’s possible to go faster but on the second day the goal is to survive,” Neuville said. Championship leader Sebastian Ogier, who won yesterday’s super special stage outside the Kasarani stadium, is fourth (+36.4). Welshman Elfyn Evans suffered the first crash of the competition after a massive whack on a rock just a few metres from a flying finish at the end of the 32.68km stretch on SS3.

Spain’s Dani Sordo became the second casualty, crashing out less than 4km from the finish after his car veered off road and into a ditch. Sordo and co-driver Borja Rozada managed to get their Hyundai Motorsport i20 back to the side of the road but their efforts were in vain and they became the second retirement of the day.
