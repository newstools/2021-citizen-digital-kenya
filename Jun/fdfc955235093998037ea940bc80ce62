Kariobangi Sharks striker Eric Kapaito admits the team is feeling the heat of dropping points in the recent defeats in the Football Kenya Federation Premier League (FKF-PL). Sharks have lost back-to-back matches falling 2-0 against Ulinzi and last weekend’s 2-1 defeat against Nairobi City Stars, but the striker is confident they will bounce back to winning ways. Being in the Golden Boot race this season, Kapaito has found it hard to put the ball in the back of the net in recent matches but he insists on team success more than individual accomplishment. “It is not a good thing the way we are dropping points as we have been giving our best in those games only that luck has not been on our side. We have to keep on working hard to ensure we don’t drop more points when the league resumes, we can’t afford to lose more in the title race,” said Kapaito. Fifth in the league standings after 18 games with 31 points, Sharks face Wazito when the league resumes on June 17 and Kapaito is hoping to use the break to worn on their mistakes. “As much as I want to win the Golden Boot this season it’s more important for me to put team ahead of individual targets because we can only win as a team. I have my targets set and that is to score goals, which translate to points which you need to win titles,” noted the striker.

There is no short cut, it is hard work with consistency,” the Harambee attacker told Citizen Digital. Video Of The Day: CAS Rachel Shebesh and athlete Asbel Kiprop share their mental health journeys
