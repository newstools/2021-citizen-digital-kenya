Six people were killed while thirty others were seriously injured when the tractor they were riding in was involved in an accident in Transmara on Tuesday morning. According to reports, the group consisted of cane-cutters from the Mumias sugar factory who were being transported to work. Trans Mara Deputy County Commissioner (DCC) Mohamed Noor Hassan confirmed the incident, stating that a lorry lost control near the Moita area and collided head-on with a tractor. “This area is a slope, we suspect that the Mitsubishi canter lost control and collided with the tractor which was carrying cane cutters from Mumias sugar factory,” Mr Hassan said on Tuesday. Five people died on the spot, and one died as a result of injuries while receiving treatment in Trans Mara. Those who were injured have been transferred to the Transmara Sub-county hospital for treatment.
