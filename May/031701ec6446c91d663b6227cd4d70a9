Two houses were on Thursday torched and several people injured after a group of youth from Ofunyu area reportedly attacked residents of the nearby Otera village in Kolwa Central, Kisumu County. This, according to sources, was in retaliation to a recent incident where a middle-aged man and his girlfriend from Ofunyu were allegedly attacked in Otera. The said man reportedly succumbed to his injuries following the Monday attack, eliciting the anger of his peers in Ofunyu. The group of youth from Ofunyu is said to have stormed Otera village seeking to retaliate against those who had attacked the deceased. Armed with crude weapons, they ransacked houses and torched two, including one belonging to a village elder, leaving some people injured as others fled for safety. One person who was seriously injured during the attack has since been rushed to the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) for treatment.
