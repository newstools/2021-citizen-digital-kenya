Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna has come out to dismiss fears that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s security was under any kind of threat after a civilian obstructed the Head of State’s convoy at Lucky Summer area in Nairobi. According to Oguna, the man was just an overzealous citizen who was excited to see President Kenyatta. “On 26 May 2021, an individual stepped infront of the Presidential motorcade during the President’s tour at Lucky Summer, Nairobi County,” he stated. “The individual is a citizen who was only excited to see the motorcade of His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta. We wish to allay any fears that the President’s security was under threat.” A middle-aged man on Wednesday afternoon unexpectedly obstructed President Kenyatta’s motorcade in Lucky Summer.
