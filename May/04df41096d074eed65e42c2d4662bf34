Police in Kisumu are holding a 63-year-old woman after a total of 950 treated mosquito nets were found in her house in USAID estate in Kisumu. Police believe the nets which are part of those given freely to Kenya by the Global Fund for free distribution to fight malaria, were stolen from Rabuor and Nyangande hospitals. County police commander Samuel Anampiu says police officers from Obunga police post acting on a tip off raided the house where they found 19 bales of the nets. He says each bale contains 50 pieces of the nets and each goes at Ksh.400 totaling to Ksh.380,000.
