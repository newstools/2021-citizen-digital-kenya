Nzoia Sugar are not worried of possible relegation from the FKF-PL despite a rut of form, head coach Ibrahim Shikanda has said. The Millers are rooted at a precarious 14th position on the log and risk being caught in a relegation dogfight should their form not improve but Shikanda is bullish there are many matches to play for which they can use to reignite their campaign. “No no no!  I can’t start saying that we are closer to being axed from the top tier league,” he protested, in an interview with Citizen Digital on Tuesday. “Still we have very many matches ahead of us to play and time is still on our side to do some corrections for improvement.” “There is absolutely nothing to fear about but we just need to up our game and remain focused,” he explained. The Bungoma-based club lost 0-1 to Kenyan powerhouse AFC Leopards on Saturday and according to Shikanda, his striking force was toothless, and that needs to be improved. “Our striking department has been very wasteful because despite numerous chances in front of goal we have nothing to call a goal,” Shikanda said, adding that, “That means there is a problem with scoring.” Also Read: There are two dependable players who have not been available, ” he said.

Nzoia are on 16 points after 16 matches having won only three, drawn seven and lost six, and only nine points above bottom-placed Mathare United who have two matches at hand. The two are scheduled to face each other in their next assignment over the weekend. Video Of The Day: Different journeys, same destiny: The story of top two candidates | KCSE 2020 |
