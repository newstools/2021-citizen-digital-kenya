Nzoia Sugar FC have returned to group training after the suspension on sports activities was lifted last week, paving way for the resumption of the FKF Premier League. The league’s schedulers have already released updated fixtures which begin on Wednesday next week although Nzoia won’t be in action until next Saturday when they visit AFC Leopards. Coach Ibrahim Shikanda says he is racing to get his charges up to speed by rehearsing their drills and added team fitness are not far from the desired levels since players had been put on individual training. “They have already started team-training and this began on Wednesday. They have been doing individual training in the last one week,” Shikanda said, adding, “the boys are eager to return on the pitch and we expect a lot from them.” Shikanda has also hailed the Government for lifting the ban saying it would allow the completion of the league and for the sports industry to recover financially. Nzoia are placed 12th on the FKF-PL standings on 19 points after 15 rounds. Also Read: Video Of The Day: Guns galore
