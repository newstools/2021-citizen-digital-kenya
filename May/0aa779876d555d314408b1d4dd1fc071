The Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) leagues won’t tip off this weekend as earlier anticipated as the federation is yet to get the green light from the ministries of health and sports. KBF fixture secretary Joseph Amoko says he is currently working on fixtures as they await further direction from the government on the way forward. “We are working on fixtures and almost through with them as we wait to get confirmation from the ministries of sports and health and I believe they will inform us before the end of the week,” he said. The leagues were halted in March when the government suspended all sporting activities in the country due to the rise of Covid-19 infections. The league fixtures are set to be announced by the end of the week with the league action expected to resume by May 15. When the league was suspended some teams had played four to five games out of the 22 league matches in a season.
