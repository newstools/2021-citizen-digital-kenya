Former Mathare United coach Salim Ali has revealed that he was sacked after refusing to resign as it had been suggested to him by his immediate former employees. Salim was fired after a spate of poor results that have seen the side remain pegged bottom of the standings after 15 rounds of matches of the FKF-PL. “They sacked me, they wanted me to resign but I did not see any need because it came as a surprise to me bearing in mind that about one and a half months ago, we had mutually agreed I finish the season then see if I can sign a new deal or not.” Said Salim. The Slum Boys played to a barren draw with fellow strugglers Vihiga United on Sunday and the lack of three points in that game might have sealed Salim’s fate at the club. Mathare occupy the last automatic relegation spot in the league with a six-point gap between them and safety. Coach Salim Ali says he is not bitter despite being sacked by the club. The club is wallowing at 17th position and fighting for relegation but Ali believes he had what it takes to keep it afloat.

It’s not,” Salim added. They have since appointed Frank Ouna with immediate effect till the end of the season. Ouna, previously with Wazito FC and Gor Mahia has a free hand to pick his assistant. Ouna took charge of Tuesday morning’s training session and he will be on the touchline for the first time on Wednesday when the Mathare United  take on KCB at Ruaraka.
