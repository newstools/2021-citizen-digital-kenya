The Federal Government of Somalia says it has restored diplomatic ties with Kenya. This comes nearly five months after Somalia cut off the relations in December last year accusing Kenya of meddling in her  politics. In a statement issued on Thursday, Somalia’s Ministry of Information said the diplomatic ties had been restored following intervention by Qatar. “The Federal Government of Somalia, announces that in keeping with the interests of good neighborliness, it has resumed diplomatic relations with the Republic of Kenya,” reads the statement. The statement further indicated that the two countries have agreed to maintain friendly relations guided by principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and that there will be no interference in the internal affairs of either of the two countries. “The two governments agree to keep friendly relations between the two countries on the basis of principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in each other internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence. The Presidents of both countries are grateful and thankful to the Emir of State of Qatar for his good offices in this regard,” concluded the statement.
