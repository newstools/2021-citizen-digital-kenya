June, who is Kenya’s Charge d’Affaires in Poland, got engaged to her Nigerian fiancé — Alexander Ezenagu — at her father’s home Karen. Her soon-to-be husband is a Hamad Bin Khalifa University assistant law professor who specializes in international tax law, transfer pricing, and tax planning. The event was attended by close family and friends. On Sunday, Mama Rachel Ruto tweeted a few photos from the engagement party.
