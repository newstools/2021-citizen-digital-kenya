The men’s 800m was the highlight of the day when three athletes attained Tokyo Games qualification time as curtains came down on a three-day Olympic pre-trial held at Nyayo Stadium. The trio of Elias Ngeny, Hillary Biwott and Noah Kibet secured the Olympic qualifying standard of 1:45.20 in the two-lap race. Ngeny won the race in a world leading time of 1:43.84 as Biwott crossed the finish line in 1:44.80 to finish second while Kibet was third in 1:45.11. Training alongside Commonwealth 800m champion Wycliffe Kinyamal at the Global Sports Communication, Ngeny said he was inspired by his training mate’s heroics at the Doha Diamond League on Friday night. Kinyamal won the race with a world leading 1:43.91 which Ngeny smashed in today’s race. “When he (Kinyamal) posted a world lead yesterday I expected I would post something close to that mark. I am expecting to represent my country at the Olympics but I know it will be tough,” said Ngeny who is yet to make his maiden appearance in Kenyan colours. Also Read: It was a case of so close yet so far for national 400m champion Mary Moraa who fell almost two seconds shy of attaining the Tokyo qualifying mark of 1:59.50 when she ran an impressive 2:01.12 “This was my fourth time racing in the 400m and I am happy I am edging closer to qualification. I however still have a lot to do before the qualification window closes on June 29. It is also somewhat difficult to qualify here in Kenya and if I could get some races abroad then I think I can make it,” said Moraa. Rongai-based Vincent Keter took the top honours in the men’s 1500m when he clocked 3:38.67 as Kamar Etyang (3:39.61) and Silas Kiplagat (3:40.00) placed second and third respectively. “I am happy to have registered my first win in the senior category. I am going to try to represent Kenya at the World Under-20 and even the Olympic Games. I am ready for both events,” he said.
