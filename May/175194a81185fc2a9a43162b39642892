Residents of Ombaka in Kisumu’s Nyando constituency are counting their losses after a night of heavy rains caused flash floods. After the school compound was completely submerged, Nyamasao Primary School suspended learning activities. The decision, which has been relayed to the county education office, was made after water snakes were spotted slithering in the school compound, according to school headteacher Hosea Nunda. So far, about 300 households have been affected by the flood’s aftermath, with the deluge destroying farms in the area. Residents have urged the government to build dykes on the Nyando River and to expedite the construction of the Soru – Koin dam in order to avert the perennial flooding that hits the area annually  Also Read: Video Of The Day: Different journeys, same destiny: The story of top two candidates | KCSE 2020 |
