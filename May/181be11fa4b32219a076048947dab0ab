Juventus have sacked coach Andrea Pirlo after just one year in charge in which he led the Italian giants to a disappointing fourth place following nine consecutive Serie A title wins. Former manager Massimiliano Allegri will return to the Turin club for a second spell two years on from his departure to replace Pirlo, who was appointed last summer with no prior coaching experience. Juve pushed to complete the deal for Allegri’s return amid concerns that other clubs could make a move for Allegri, Sky Italia reported, after Inter Milan terminated Antonio Conte’s contract and Zinedine Zidane announced he was leaving Real Madrid. Allegri’s confirmation is expected to arrive once the two parties agree on whether he will sign on for three or four years, according to reports. Reuters has contacted Juventus for confirmation. Allegri won five Serie A titles in a row in his first spell in Turin between 2014 and 2019, as well as lifting the Coppa Italia four times and finishing as Champions League runners-up twice.
