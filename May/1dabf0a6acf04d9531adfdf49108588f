The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) has re-advertised its Managing Director post, 20 months since the start of the process in September 2019. The fresh recruitment process will see the airports manager receive new applications between Tuesday and May 21. Applicants who had applied for the role nearly two years ago have been encouraged to re-apply. The board of KAA has not offered an explanation to the delay in recruiting a substantive Chief Executive Officer for the State parastatal. KAA’s Managing Director post fell vacant on August 30, 2019 with the then MD Johnny Andersen announcing his intent to quit before his close of term citing personal reasons. Andersen was succeeded by Finance General Manager Alex Gitari on an interim basis. Also Read: His exit came on the backdrop of the fall out of a planned joint venture (JV)/operational merger with Kenya Airways (KQ) which also saw KQ CEO Sebastian Mikosz announce his departure from the carrier in May 2019. The foiled JV flung Johnny Andersen to the public limelight for the very first time since joining KAA in November 2016. KAA’s next Managing Director will receive a three year contract of employment from the parastatal. Video Of The Day: Different journeys, same destiny: The story of top two candidates | KCSE 2020 |
