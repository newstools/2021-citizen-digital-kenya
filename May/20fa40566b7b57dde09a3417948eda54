Eldoret City Marathon, which was postponed indefinitely in March and was due on April 11, will now be held June 6, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago who is also the race patron said on Thursday. Making the announcement in Eldoret town, Mandago said the race was on after the Government lifted suspension of all sports activities in the country, adding provided health guidelines will be strictly adhered to. “I am encouraging the residents of this town to run every day in the morning to improve our health status and reduce cost on acquiring health services. I urge amateur runners to register for the 5km run and after that let’s make it our culture,” Mandago said. He directed the Local Organizing Committee (LOC), which is led by the two-time Boston Marathon winner Moses Tanui to step up preparations as per the issued protocols. He cautioned athletes not to register for the race if they know they have used banned substance. Race director Tanui said an electronic timing system will be used in this year’s marathon for authenticity. Also Read: Three-hundred and 26 athletes had already registered.
