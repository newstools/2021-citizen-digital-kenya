Three Cameroonians will be charged with various criminal offences relating to forgery and being in the country illegally, according to a Nairobi court. The three men arrested last week in Ruiru, Paulin Francis Proper, Job Kentong, and Njikam Omar, have been ordered to appear in court on May 18.  They were in possession of more than Ksh.350 million in counterfeit US dollars and British pounds, according to detectives who conducted the arrests. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), two of the suspects were found to be in the country illegally while one holds a refugee identity card. “Upon further interrogation of Paulin Francis who is the main suspect detectives raided his house in Muthaiga North where the firearm was recovered,” said the DCI in statement.

The prosecution is now awaiting forensic reports from the British and American embassies, a ballistics examination report, and a report from the government chemist. “We anticipate being ready for plea taking when the matter comes up for mention on May 18, 2021,” the court was told. Danstan Omari, the defense lawyer, requested that the number of detention days be reduced, but the magistrate declined, stating that the orders issued under a miscellaneous application were granted by a different magistrate. “I will be accused of sitting on an appeal of a matter of a fellow magistrate,” He said.
