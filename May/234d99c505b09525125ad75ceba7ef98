Zoo FC will appeal against the decision to expel them from the FKF Premier League. According to information posted on their official Twitter account, the Kericho-based side said they will pursue all available legal avenues to ensure the decision is reversed. On Tuesday, Zoo received communication from FIFA relegating them from the FKF Premier League over match-fixing allegations but they are pleading innocence. ‘’We have since prepared our Appeal to the FIFA Appeals Committee under art. 56 FIFA Disciplinary Code which we shall soon file and are confident our appeal shall be successful. According to the club, the decision was taken on ‘misguided information’ and they will be seeking a stay of the execution of the said decision in order to continue featuring in the top tier league. The club says they will in the next 10 days write to FIFA to seek further details that led to the decision which they believe was based on misinformed legal concept of strict liability ‘’We were surprised to receive a communique from FIFA that unfortunately held us responsible for match manipulation pursuant to art. 8 FDC as read with art. 18 pars 1 and 2 FIFA Disciplinary Code and, eventually, we were dropped from the top tier league.’’ Also Read: Zoo added that it is their belief that the Report was inadequate and its findings doubtful.
