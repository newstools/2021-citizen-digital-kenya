National carrier Kenya Airways (KQ) has signed an interline agreement with South Africa’s regional carrier Airlink. The pact is expected to extend KQ’s reach in the Southern Africa region via the cities of Johannesburg and Cape Town. For instance, Kenya Airways customers flying into South Africa will be able to connect with Airlink-operated flights to Windhoek, Durban, Gaborone, Maputo and Port Elizabeth. On the flip-side, the pact enables Airlink passengers to book a through ticket to Nairobi and tap connections to regional destinations including Entebbe, Kigali, Dar es Salaam, Bujumbura and Kinshasa. The pact strengthens aviation ties between Kenya and Southern Africa. “As global economies continue to reel from the effects of the pandemic, such strategic partnerships are critical. These new routes will positively impact the flow of trade and tourism across the region by offering our customers convenient travel around the continent,” said Julius Thairu, KQ Acting Chief Commercial Officer.
