Raila Odinga, leader of the Orange Democratic Movement, has pointed fingers at Kenyan security agencies, claiming that the by-elections in the Bonchari and Juja constituencies demonstrated willful abuse of police power and impunity. Raila said in a statement on Wednesday that elections are a chance for voters to express themselves, not for politicians to pursue ‘imaginary and short-lived political interests.’ “What we have witnessed in the by-elections in Bonchari and Juja is an abuse of police powers and an arrogant display of IMPUNITY by a few overzealous and bellicose government functionaries,” the ODM leader Tweeted. “Security forces exist to serve the people and not the interests of those out to conduct political experiments.” The former Prime Minister stated in his statement that peaceful coexistence after 2018 should not be taken for granted. He accused several shadowy politicians of using the Handshake as an excuse to erode hard-won liberties. “Some rogue elements who want to use the HANDSHAKE as an excuse to ERODE our hard-earned liberties must NOT take the peaceful coexistence after 2018 for granted! This has to stop!” He went on to say.
