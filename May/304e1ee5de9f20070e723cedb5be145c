Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho’s online spat with airline company Safarilink failed to take off on Friday, leaving the governor with an egg on his face. The Mombasa County executive had accused the airline of being untrustworthy and uncouth in a Tweet. “In this ever-increasingly competitive world, the aviation industry has no place for such unprofessional, unreliable, and uncouth behaviour as exhibited by Safarilink,” the governor wrote on Twitter. Safarilink then replied to the governor’s Twitter post asking him to elaborate what his issue was for a faster resolution. “Dear Hon. Hassan Joho, thank you for your feedback and although you did not share your complaint we respond as follows. Our scheduled flight from Vipingo Ridge, to Nairobi departs at 16:00 hrs and the check in counters close 30 minutes before the flight departs,” the airline wrote. The governor arrived at the Vipingo airstrip around 16:04pm on the material date, according to Safarilink. Over thirty-four minutes late for the flight which was scheduled to depart at exactly 16.00 hours. Also Read: “As a premier airline, we offer an on-time service for all our flights,” the airline said. “We understand you arrived at Vipingo Airstrip at 16:04 hrs, which is past the departure time.” At the same time, the airline emphasized the importance of all customers, regardless of social status, treating others with respect especially by arriving on time. “We also need to respect our other customers who were on time and on board.” the airline said on Twitter. The incident sparked a flurry of online discussion, with scores of people criticizing the county boss Ciku Muiruri, a former radio host turned author, tweeted: “The people who make you do well (it’s been proven time and time again), are always the ones who mean to do you harm. #BoycottSafariLink backfires, instead gives Flysafarilink free publicity and makes Hassan Ali Joho look like a child having a tantrum,” The people who make you do well (it's been proven time and time again), are always the ones who mean to do you harm. #BoycottSafariLink backfires, instead gives @Flysafarilink free publicity and makes @HassanAliJoho look like a child having a tantrum. pic.twitter.com/bm01J947Mt — Ciku Muiruri (@MissCiku) May 22, 2021  While, Radio Host and chef,  Mandi Sarro, added an eye-roll emoji to her tweet, saying: “You people feel so damn entitled. Yet you were the one who was late.” You people feel so damn entitled. Yet you were the one who was late. 🙄 — Mandi Sarro – TDQ (@MissMandii) May 21, 2021  Another user, John Njenga, asked the governor to show up on time for his next flight, stop acting like a victim, and respect other people’s jobs. Mr. Ali Hassan Joho 1. Arrive on time for your flight.2. A flight is not a matatu ride.3. You were late (!), flight was on time.4. Stop misusing your office.5. Stop playing victim.6.

The governor was charged alongside Changamwe MCA, Bernard Ogutu. Justice Munyao Sila, who delivered the verdict on Friday, stated that breaking the law is not heroic and urged leaders to set a good example. “Kenyans love peace and would like to live in a country where leaders lead from the front in respecting the rule of law,” said Justice Sila. “We want to live in a country that respects the rule of law and obeys a court order,” he added. Despite being found culpable, Justice Munyao stated that the Governor who appeared in court showed no remorse. “There is not much remorse in Mr Hassan Joho’s mitigation statement, his apparent lack of remorse is very perturbing to this court,” Justice Sila said. In addition to the fine, the governor will be held liable for any damages suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the incident.
