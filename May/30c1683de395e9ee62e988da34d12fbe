England manager Gareth Southgate will name a provisional extended squad for Euro 2020 on Tuesday, rather than the final 26 players as originally planned. The decision has been made given the number of England players involved in this week’s Champions League and Europa League finals. It also considers the injuries to key players including Manchester United centre-back Harry Maguire and Burnley keeper Nick Pope. The squad will be named at 4pm East African time. The final 26 will be named on 1 June. Manchester United face Villarreal in the final of the Europa League on Wednesday, with Manchester City and Chelsea meeting in the Champions League final on Saturday.
