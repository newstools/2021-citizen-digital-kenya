Spectators will not be allowed to attend sports events, the Cabinet Secretary for Sports Amina Mohamed said as she finally rolled out a raft of measures that will govern the resumption of sporting activities. In a statement, CS Amina also announced Kenya will send its first athletes’ delegation to Kurume City in Fukuoka on July 5 for a pre-camp ahead of the Olympic Games scheduled to begin on July 23 in Tokyo, Japan. All Olympic participating teams will be accommodated at designated Bubble training camps in strict compliance with the Ministry of Health Guidelines and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games playbook. “Testing of Athletes shall be done every 96 hours until the commencement of the Olympic Games to ensure that Kenyan athletes are safe and exposed to the rigors of Covid-19 control expected in Tokyo,” the statement said. Private fitness clubs have been allowed to re-open immediately while observing all provided containment measures although all Under-18 sports remain suspended. The announcement comes two weeks after President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the suspension on all sports activities while urging the Ministries of Sports and Health to develop a road map for which those activities could be safely carried out.
