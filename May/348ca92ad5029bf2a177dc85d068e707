The team that tops the FKF-Premier League by June 30 will represent Kenya in the CAF Champions League. According to Football Kenya Federation (FKF), the move is occasioned by a strict CAF deadline that requires them to submit the name of the representative by June 30th. The Kenyan league had been halted for close to two months in the wake of a government ban on sports, aimed at arresting the  increase of Covid-19 cases in the country. The announcement by FKF is set to spark a fierce battle between the league’s top dogs Tusker FC, AFC Leopards Bandari, and champions Gor Mahia as they jostle for the coveted slot. Last year Gor earned the nod in the wake of a season halted midway thanks to Covid-19. However their lacklustre performances so far this season means they have their work cut out as they rank sixth on the log, 12 points adrift of league leaders Tusker albeit with two games in hand. Also Read: KCB is the only team that has not tested continental football as AFC Leopards, Kariobangi Sharks, and Bandari have participated in the past four seasons – either in the CAF Champions League or CAF Confederations Cup. Tusker last played at the continental extravaganza in 2016 following their domestic double under Ugandan tactician Paul Nkata. Gor Mahia has been Kenya’s only representative since then even though their performances have been wanting more so in the CAF Champions League. The federation has not announced the criterion that will be used to select its representatives in the CAF Confederations Cup as there is no clear winner of the Shield Cup who could directly make the cut for the event as it was halted before its quarter-finals stage owing to the government directive that stopped all sports activities in the country in mid-March this year.
