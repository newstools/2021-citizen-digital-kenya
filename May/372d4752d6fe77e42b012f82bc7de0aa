Nakuru West Member of Parliament Samuel Arama has been dealt a blow after the High Court on Wednesday set aside a lower court decision that had acquitted the lawmaker and two others of corruption charges in 2019. Anti-Corruption Court Magistrate Douglas Ogoti had in November 2019 dismissed the case citing lack of evidence against the MP and his co-accused. “I hereby acquit the three accused persons under Section 210 and order their cash bail of Ksh.1 million deposited in court to be refunded to them,” the Milimani Law Court Chief Magistrate ruled at the time. The Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) had appealed the ruling and over a year later, High Court judge James Wakiaga has now ruled that the three should be put on their defence. The case will be mentioned on June 15 for further directions. In June 2018, Arama and his co-accused faced charges of abuse of office, conspiracy to defraud, making a document without authority, uttering a document with intent to deceive, obtaining registration of land by false pretenses and knowingly misleading an investigator.
