The Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) has approved Lady Justice Martha Koome’s nomination as Kenya’s first female Chief Justice. Her approval comes after a special session of the same committee at the National Assembly on Wednesday. The Committee, chaired by Muturi Kigano, tabled a report on the committee’s findings on Justice Koome’s suitability to replace emeritus Chief Justice David Maraga. The report, which will now be debated in the August House, comes after Justice Koome was vetted by the same committee last week. If her nomination is approved by the House, it will be forwarded to President Uhuru Kenyatta for formal appointment. Koome, who has an estimated 33 years in the legal profession, was selected by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) among 10 candidates who were interviewed for the position of Chief Justice.
