Wazito FC head coach Francis Kimanzi has urged his players to bounce back and get maximum points against Tusker FC when they clash on Friday in Nairobi. FKF Premier League leaders Tusker won the reverse leg 1-0 and Kimanzi admits they are wary of the quality of players in their opposition who top the league standings. “They are on top of the table for a reason, they are a very strong side with top players who if you make a mistake they can punish you. “We have to capitalize on the chances we create and convert them into goals. That’s what we failed to do in the first leg. We know how important this game is and we have the right player to deliver maximum points that we seriously need,” Kimanzi said. Last weekend both teams failed to pick maximum points with Wazito losing 2-0 against Sofapaka while Tusker were held to a barren draw by KCB in the first round of the league since it restarted. “We struggled last weekend because of the level of fitness of our players this week I have seen remarkable improvement this week in training and I am hoping we will be able fight in the coming matches ,” Kimanzi added.

But Kimanzi disagrees. “The excitement of winning the league is when you are produced as the winning because you were better than the rest of the teams in the league for the rest of the season, but when you are created as a champion before the league ends. It is very unfair for the rest of the teams in the league,” the veteran tactician told Citizen Digital.
