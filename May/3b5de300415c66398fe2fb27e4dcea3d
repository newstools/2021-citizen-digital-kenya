Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu Hassan on Friday said the elderly in the country will be taught about COVID-19 safety protocols as they are the most vulnerable segment of the population when it comes to the pandemic. President Suluhu’s remarks are the latest indication of a looming change in policy when it comes to how Tanzania handles the coronavirus. She said a taskforce appointed to examine the issue will soon submit a report which will guide the government on any new measures. The donning of masks by the leadership of the country at a public meeting attended by hundreds of elderly citizens who also wore masks is the latest illustration of the change taking place in the country. Tanzania under the late President John Magufuli refused to acknowledge the existence of COVID-19, saying the virus had been eradicated from the country. “Ili tuwakinge wazee wetu, tumeamua leo tuvae barakoa, kwa sababu mkutano huu ni mkusanyiko huu ni mkubwa na tumeshindwa kuwaweka mbali mbali, mmekaa pamoja,” she said.

Sisi watoto wenu tunazunguka sana huko manchi mengine, hatuwezi kujua, kwa hivo ni vyema kujikinga pamoja na nyie.”  Video Of The Day: Guns galore
