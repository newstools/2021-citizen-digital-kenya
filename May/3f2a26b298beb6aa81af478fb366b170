Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo on Tuesday re-submitted the name of former West Mugirango MP James Gesami for vetting as his Deputy Governor. This comes after the Nyamira County Assembly previously rejected Gesami’s nomination on grounds that he had not submitted crucial documents like his HELB, CRB and EACC certificates. The DG nominee was also said to have a clearance certificate from the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), leading to 21 MCAs out of the 36 rejecting his nomination. “I have read the report of the County Assembly dated January 2021 containing the reasons for the decision of the County Assembly,” read a letter from Governor Nyaribo to the Nyamira County Assembly on Tuesday. “I have also discussed the said report with the Deputy Governor nominee who has assured me that the circumstances relied upon for rejection of his appointment have since ceased to exist.” He further added: “In the premises, I nominate Dr. James Ondicho Gesami for appointment as Deputy Governor Nyamira County, and hereby, pursuant to the provisions of Section 10 (2) of the Public Appointment (County Assemblies Approval) Act, 2017 resubmit the name of Dr. James Ondicho Gesami for vetting and approval by the County Assembly as required by law.” Also Read: Video Of The Day: Different journeys, same destiny: The story of top two candidates | KCSE 2020 |
