Senate Deputy Speaker Margaret Kamar has said there is need for the amendment of the Political Parties Act to enhance democracy for women. Prof Kamar said there is a provision in the Act for the use of party funds to be used to promote democracy and development of candidates, including women, but most of the parties do not prioritise this. “We are taking stock and we will look at how the law was crafted so that we amend the Act to ensure that every political party nominates their quarter of each gender,” she said. Prof. Kamar who is also the Uasin Gishu Senator said parties must also provide same finances to develop women. She opined that the reason why more women are wanted in leadership is not for the sake of one gender but for the society. The Deputy speaker said leaders have realised that development will be more uniform if both genders are at the decision-making table: be it in parliament or the executive.
