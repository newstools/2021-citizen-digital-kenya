The Form One selection exercise was supposed to start at the end of this week, specifically May 28, but it has since been postponed. This now means that learners who sat the 2020 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examination have to wait a little longer to know the secondary schools they will join. Although Education Cabinet Secretary Prof. George Magoha did not give any reason for the postponement, he assured Kenyans that there is no cause for alarm. The exercise has been pushed to mid next month with the CS saying it will be free and fair. “Form One selection is going to commence soon, and we shall announce to the public by about June 15…I want to further explain that there is no cause for alarm because we shall place every child in a secondary school…100% transition,” CS Magoha said on Monday. At the same time, the ministry directed the Kenya University and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS) to open its system for courses review by students slated to join higher learning institutions this year.
