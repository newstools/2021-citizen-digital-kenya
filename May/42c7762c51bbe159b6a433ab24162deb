Chairman of Kenya Football Coaches Association Ricky Solomon has criticized the manner in which Football Kenya Federation wants to select Kenyan representatives in the continental tournament. In a statement, FKF announced that the team that will top the standings by the end of June will earn the right to represent Kenya in CAF Champions league next season even though the league will not yet be concluded. Instead, the former Harambee Stars player wants the federation to stage three matches per week for every team and honour the full fixture by 30th June which is CAF’s deadline. “We used to play on Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday every week and I think FKF can borrow the idea so as to finish the league”, said Solomon. He added, “It is not fair to award a team CAF ticket when they are not the league champions.” In the CAF Confederations cup, the federation has already lay out the fixture from round of 32 to final within June to ensure Kenya don’t miss out the ticket like last season.
