I believe I was better than him in the first three rounds but I respect the referees’ decisions, it boxing. I thank God for how far he has brought me. “The coaches have seen all the mistakes and strengths and we shall work on them as we continue preparing for the Olympics,” said Okoth. Africa Zone Three super heavyweight champion Elly Ajowi registered almost the same results, losing 30-27, 30-27, 30-27, 30-27 and 30-27 against Madiyar Saidrahimov of Uzbekistan.

Head coach Musa Benjamin picked the positives from the contests. “Nick was in control in round one but in round two he allowed his opponent to come back into the game but in round three Nick was on top also. Getting into rage and of range is his biggest challenge and we are going to rectify it back home,” said Musa. The nine-day tournament began on May 11 at Lenina Regional Sports Complex Stadium in the city of Khabarovsk, where they have been flexing their muscles with Europe’s crème de la crème. The team is also scheduled to feature in another international assignment in the Philippines next month, in a final friendly assignment before they go to Japan.
