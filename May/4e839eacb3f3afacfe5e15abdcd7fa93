AFC Leopards head coach Patrick Aussems has challenged his charges to be more prolific in scoring, saying the narrow wins they have been registering have been exposed by newbies Bidco United. On Sunday, the title-chasing Leopards were beaten by the Oilers 1-3, the Belgian tactician raising concerns over his strike force bluntness. In the last five matches, Leopards have scored only three goals in the Premier League, a tally Aussems is worried about. “You know the problem comes when you concede three goals, it is very difficult to win a game especially for us because we don’t score easily,” said Aussems. “When we made the first mistake, then the second goal mistake which was even a little bit stupid we put pressure on ourselves. The third mistake hence the third goal meant it was difficult to come back, and although football is about mistakes anyway, we made more than our opponents and that is why they punished us,” he added. Aussems also rued missed chances saying Leopards had a chance to seize command of the proceedings within the first half. Also Read: “Because we shot a lot on the opponents goal in first half and in second half we did not shoot a lot, it simply means we should have made impact within the first 45. We missed but you know it’s like that, sometimes it is better to concede three goals in one game than to concede a goal and lose three games in a row,” noted Aussems. Leopards dropped to third with 36 points due to inferior goal difference to KCB as Tusker rose to the summit on 38 points after thrashing Vihiga United 4-0 at Mumias Sports Complex. The 12-time champions now shift their focus to the FKF Shield where they face Posta Rangers on Wednesday.
