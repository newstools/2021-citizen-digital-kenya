Emyba and Storms head coach Abel Nson has urged local-based players to learn from their counterparts who ply their trade abroad to help Kenya stage a successful return to the men’s FIBA Afrobasket championships. Speaking to Citizen Digital from Kigali, Rwanda where he is attending the inaugural FIBA and National Basketball Association-sponsored Basketball Africa League (BAL) Nson insists it will take more than the foreign legion for Kenya to have a successful outing in the African Championships. “Players who play abroad have a different perspective of the game since they have interacted with elite players in a very competitive environment. “That’s why you always see a difference whenever a player of this type play. They know how to have an impact on the game. For Kenya to go toe-to-toe with the best in the continent the local-based players should be eager to learn to help Kenya record good results in the tournament.” Nson says his absence from the country has not affected his teams’ preparations adding that they will be good to go when the resumption date is confirmed by the federation. “I believe my teams have a solid foundation that can facilitate their training. We have already started training and am in touch with them regarding training schedules.” Also Read: He believes many teams will struggle to replicate their bright start before the government’s directive to stop all sports activities owing to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. His primary objective will be to ensure that players regain fitness a feat that will help them stage a stronger finish at the tail end of the season. “We want to peak when it matters. For instance, it could be wasteful if we started the league brightly and then burn out towards the end. “We understand other factors could come into play like injuries. However, we want to play decent and our game as the season wears on,” he added. Video Of The Day: Different journeys, same destiny: The story of top two candidates | KCSE 2020 |
