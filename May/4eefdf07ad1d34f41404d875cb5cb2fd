Garissa Police Station OCS Michael Munyalo Wambua was on Thursday arraigned in court on allegations of murdering Morris Kimathi, a carpenter, on Saturday night in DRC area along Bula Sheikh Road. The prosecution asked the magistrate on Thursday to detain the police chief for 14 days, arguing that witnesses to the case were dispersed across the country and it would be difficult to reach them. His defence, on the other hand, sought bail, arguing that the police chief has an impeccable record spanning 37 years in the force. However, Garissa senior resident magistrate Timothy Ole Tanju denied the bail application, citing the officer’s continued presence in the office shortly after the incident. He ordered that the police chief be held at the Madogo police station for ten days pending the outcome of the investigation. “Given that the respondent has remained in the office since the day of the alleged incident, and for the reasons stated in the affidavit,” the Magistrate said, “I’m inclined to grant the applicant 10 days to complete the investigations.” Also Read: According to eyewitnesses, the deceased, Kimathi aged 28, was shot in the back as he crossed the road, just moments after an altercation with Mr.Munyalo at a bar. Garissa County Commander Ranson Lolmodoni confirmed the incident, stating that the crime scene had been visited, documented, and an investigation was underway.
