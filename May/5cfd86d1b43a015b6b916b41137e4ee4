Captain Peter Gin Juma says Nzoia will aim to bounce back from Saturday’s 1-0 defeat to AFC Leopards when they host basement side Mathare United at Sudi Stadium in Bungoma. Juma said he felt they deserved at least a draw against Leopards, ruing missed chances that were ultimately punished as Caleb Olilo’s goal on the stroke of half time proved the winner for the hosts. Nzoia sit 12th on the FKF Premier League standings with 19 points and enjoy relative comfort away from the relegation scrapheap where Mathare are rooted. According to Juma, a top six finish is a possibility. “It is evident we are not sitting in a prestigious position and that eventually will push us into the next match full of hunger to collect maximum points. “Anywhere within the top six places will be a great achievement for us in a season like this where challenges have been all round as far as football is concerned in the country.
