Kenyan basketball international Ariel Okall is optimistic of winning the league title with Kampala International University(KIU) Titans after joining them from Oman. Okall’s move to join the Ugandan club comes after the halting of sports activities in Oman due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “My expectation is winning the top league with KIU, that’s paramount. My contract is just for this season but my management team will sit with the club to see if I can be here for much longer. It was easy to decide to join this club because first it’s a good team and I have many friends here,” said Okall. Okall was on the losing end during his debut as the varsity side fell 58-66 to JKL Dolphins. The defeat was preceded by victory over Betway Power. The 30- year-old had been tipped to join City Oilers in Lugogo, but ended up in KIU’s camp. “When I was coming back home from Oman, the Oilers had closed their transfer business and here at KIU I have a good working rapport with the management. I had hoped to play in Kenya but when making my decision, sports was still under suspension, so I had to make quick decisions,” added Ariel.

His first game came before any training session with the side and he posted just five points and three rebounds in a game that KIU lost 58-66 to JKL Dolphins after beating Betway Power in their first game. After two games they occupy position 8 while City Oilers are on top after winning all four. His addition to the Titans squad is huge as he adds depth; both defensively and offensively. It won’t be the first time for Okall to ply his trade in Uganda as he featured for Falcons BC in 2015. Video Of The Day: Guns galore
