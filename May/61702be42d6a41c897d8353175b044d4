The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) has launched investigations into the suspected murder of two men whose bodies were retrieved from Thika River after they were reportedly arrested by police. The two young men; Nicholas Maithya and Asman Kamau aged 15 and 18, had been arrested by police officers and the assistant chief, Rubiru village in Gatanga who accused them of participating in rampant brewing of illicit liquor along the river. Gatanga Deputy Sub-county Police Commander Simon Mulu said the two men drowned while running away from the assistant chief who was pursuing illegal brewers along the river.
