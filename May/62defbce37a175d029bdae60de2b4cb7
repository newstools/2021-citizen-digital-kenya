Kenya football giants Gor Mahia have leapt to position four on the FKF Premier League table after recording a slender 1-0 win over Wazito in a match staged at the Utalii grounds in Nairobi Monday afternoon. Burundian Jules Ulimwengu scored the sole goal in the 82nd minute to earn Gor the three vital points. Gor were however reduced to ten men after Samwel Onyango was given matching orders in stoppage time for unsporting behavior. K’Ogalo now have 31 points from 17 matches, just seven shy of leaders Tusker, with a game at hand that could further narrow the gap to four. With the upturn in form, they have a realistic chance of topping the table by June 30 to bag a ticket to the CAF Champions League.
