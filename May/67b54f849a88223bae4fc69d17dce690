West Ham forward Jesse Lingard has been named Premier League Player of the Month for April, with Newcastle boss Steve Bruce winning the managers’ award. Lingard, on loan from Manchester United, scored four goals in four league games last month, taking his tally to nine for the season since joining West Ham on loan at the start of February. His solo goal against Wolves also saw him win Goal of the Month. Lingard collected the ball 10 yards inside his own half, powered towards goal before producing an ice-cool finish to beat the onrushing Rui Patricio. The 28-year-old had not played a minute of Premier League football this season prior to his Manchester United exit, but has been directly involved in 12 goals since his arrival at West Ham. Only Leicester City’s Kelechi Iheanacho posts better figures. Bruce oversaw two wins and two draws from Newcastle’s four matches to ease fears of relegation, fighting back from losing positions in three of those fixtures.

But Bruce, who has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park, has vowed to stay on as manager next season. “I’m a football manager. It’s what I do and I’m not ready to retire yet, so you have to dust yourself down, have a thick skin at times,” he said. “As I said, I’m nowhere near ready to retire just yet, so I’ll crack on to the best of my ability.” Newcastle are safe in 16th position ahead of Friday’s visit of champions Manchester City.
