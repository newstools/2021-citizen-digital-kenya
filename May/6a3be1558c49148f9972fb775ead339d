Heavy rainfall witnessed in the last 24 hours in many parts of the country is likely to reduce intensity from Friday and Saturday. This is according to the Kenya Meteorological Department which said the rainfall more than 30mm has been observed over parts of the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, the Lake Victoria Basin, the Central Rift Valley, the Northwest, the South Eastern Lowlands, the Northeast and the Highlands East of the Rift Valley including Nairobi County. “Due to already high-water levels in some rivers and other water retention areas, it is likely that the rains may cause flooding over flood plains and other areas not well drained,” said the weatherman. “Mudslides and landslides are also likely to occur on hilly areas of the Highlands West of the Rift Valley and the Highlands East of the Rift Valley due to already saturated soils.” The met department further urged motorists to remember to check their safety precautions when parking their cars.
