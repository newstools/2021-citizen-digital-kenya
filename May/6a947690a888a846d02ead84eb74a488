Kakamega Homeboyz first team duo of Moses Mudavadi and Shami Kibwana will play no part in Friday’s FKF-Premier League clash against Kariobangi Sharks. According to head head coach Nicholas Muyoti, the two dependable players are nursing injuries and it is definite they can’t recover in time for the duel scheduled to take place in Nairobi. “As our norm, we have prepared very well apart from a few injury concerns in the squad but I can assure you that my boys are ready for the Friday match. We have Shami Kibwana and Moses Mudavadi who are ruled out due to injuries,” Muyoti said. Nonetheless, Muyoti is aiming to ensure Homeboyz finish with better points than last season’s 47. “Our target is to jump above last season’s mark of 47 points; this means that we are obligated to do much better than that. Allan Wanga is in the right shape for the game and so is the rest of the squad,” he added. Also Read: Muyoti is also eager for the players to be back after a ‘tough period’ without football due to the coronavirus pandemic that hit the country in March last year. “We are very grateful that the boys are back on the pitch and this will help them earn their allowances to support them at this point in time when some of them who are parents are taking their children back to school.” Homeboyz are eighth on 21 points after 16 matches while their opponents Sharks sit fourth on 28 points in 15 matches.
