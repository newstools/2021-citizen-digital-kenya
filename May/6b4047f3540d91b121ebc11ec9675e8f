Police in Kirinyaga County arrested 15 students who were found drunk at a rental house in Gichugu. The area police boss Anthony Mbogo said three girls were among the students who were discovered inside a room at Mucangara Trading Centre. “We have confirmed that they are students from various secondary schools who are supposed to report back to school on Monday and Tuesday,” Mbogo said. He said police officers also found a carton containing six bottles of ice vodka — four of which were empty — some CDs and gambling cards which will be used as exhibits in court. Mbogo said the students are being held at Kianyaga Police Station and they will be arraigned in Gichugu Law Courts on Monday morning. Also Read: Video Of The Day: Guns galore
