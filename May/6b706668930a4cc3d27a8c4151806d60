AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia FC stewards say they can’t wait to see football return once again after months on pause due to the suspension of sports activities. Ingwe’s deputy chief steward Edwin Ambeyi admitted they have struggled without game allowances and have also missed match-day atmosphere. “I think it is another opportune time we have to meet our players and the team at large and also to continue with the services we offer them. We are happy to be back in stadia,” Ambeyi told Citizen Digital. His sentiments were echoed by his counterpart Lawi Odhiambo who is Gor’s chief steward. “It has been a big challenge to us as stewards, reason being that we eat and drink sports daily because a lot of people earn their livelihood through sports.” And what is it that a steward must do during match-day? Also Read: “Generally our work is to ensure our team’s safety is priority, which gate the team bus will use to enter the stadium and that everything is in good shape before the kick-off. It is the work of stewards to thwart any form of violence fashioned towards the playing unit,” Ambeyi stated. The FKF Premier League will resume tomorrow with archrivals Gor and Leopards due to clash for their leg match later next month.
