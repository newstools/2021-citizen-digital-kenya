President Uhuru Kenyatta and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid virtual visits to Westlands Primary School in Westlands and Cleves Cross Primary School in Ferryhill, England, on Thursday as part of the Global Partnership for Education (DPE) initiative. The two schools are part of a program that allows students to engage with peers from other countries on global issues such as climate action and gender equality. The visits provided a direct opportunity to directly engage with students aged 9 to 11 years old, as well as create a high-profile moment for championing education for all, with a special emphasis on technology and girls’ education. President Kenyatta advised the pupils at Westlands Primary School shortly after the virtual conversation to continue acting responsibly in the wake of Covid-19 by following disease containment measures such as proper mask use, regular handwashing, and social distancing. The Head of State was accompanied by Dr Joseph Kinyua, Head of Public Service, Prof George Magoha, Education CS, and Joe Mucheru, ICT CS. Area MP Tim Wanyonyi, British High Commissioner Jane Marriott, and State House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Strategy Mrs Ruth Kagia were also present.
