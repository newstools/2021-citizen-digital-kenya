Ulinzi Stars head coach Benjamin Nyagweso is wary of the physical threat posed by Nzoia Sugar ahead of their FKF Premier League clash on Friday. Ulinzi defeated Kariobangi Sharks 2-0 last week and the veteran tactician was impressed by his team’s balance between defence and attack in the crucial victory. “They (Nzoia) are not a weak team at all; they are very physical in attack and midfield. I know they will push us to the limit but we are determined to win,” Nyagweso said. The veteran tactician also noted there was an improvement in the fitness level of his players and added he hopes for better performances in the coming games. “The break affected my players physically but from what I am seeing in training and the previous match is impressive. This should prepare us to manage the congested fixtures,” Nyangweso stated. The 2010 champions are currently ninth in the league standing with 21 points from 17 games while Nzoia after 14th with 17 points from 17 games Nyagweso believes his side will fight for every three points available to finish in a better position.
