Kariobangi Sharks striker Eric Kapaito has told his teammates not to get carried away by the good run they have had so far in the top division as they rack up the pressure on leaders Tusker and second-placed AFC Leopards. On Friday Sharks beat Kakamega Homeboyz 1-0  to jump to third on the log on 31 points, six shy of leaders Tusker and  one shy of the big cats Ingwe, and  Kapaito insists the league is far from hence the need to concentrate on getting maximum points in the remaining games. “It is always good when you win a football match especially after a big break. It may take us time to be at the level we were before the break but I believe we have the quality of players to win us the crucial football matches in determining the winner of the league,” Said Kapaito. Having scored 14 goals in 16 games so far this term, Kapaito insists on putting teamwork ahead of individual accolades. “I always put team first ahead of individual awards. I’m top the scoring chat because of my teammates. They have been outstanding in their different contributions and  one thing for sure is that we are determined as a team to fight for the title, “added Kapaito. The ‘Slum Boys’ will host struggling Western Stima on Thursday, but Kapaito has warned his teammates to respect their opponents.
