Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has denied reports he has told his players he is leaving the Spanish giants. Media reports claimed the Frenchman informed his squad a week ago that he would leave at the end of the season. Zidane led Real to a 1-0 win at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday, to take the La Liga title race to the final day. “How could I tell the players I’m leaving now? We’re giving our everything for the title and I just say ‘by the way, I’m off’?” he said. “People outside the club can say whatever they like, but I would never, ever say that to my players.” Real are two points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid, who came from behind to beat Osasuna 2-1 at home.

The last game of the season is far more important than that.” Zidane, 48, is in his second spell as manager at Real, having won three consecutive Champions League titles in his first between 2016 and 2018.
