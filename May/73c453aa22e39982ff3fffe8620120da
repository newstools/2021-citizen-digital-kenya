The trial court hearing the Ksh. 791million National Youth Service (NYS) case was forced to adjourn its sitting on Wednesday after it turned out that two accused persons have no lawyer to represent them. The court was told that lawyer representing Ben Gethi passed on and is yet to be buried. “On grounds of passing on of the lawyer and for lack of representation the hearing can’t proceed today,” the court ruled Further, Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi dismissed a bid to bar the media from covering Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru’s testimony as a witness in the case.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions through Jalson Makori had sought to have the press barred from covering the proceedings citing fear of misreporting.

They added that the reasons given by state lawyer to have the media barred is wrong. “We don’t know whether Makori wants to protect the integrity of the proceedings or the witness,” court heard Three civilian witnesses and five investigating officers are yet to testify. On August 5-6, Governor Waiguru will testify against former PS Peter Mangiti, ex-Director General Nelson Githinji and 22 others.
