Robinson Kamura says AFC Leopards have the stamina to push on and top of FKF-PL by June 30, the date by which FKF have said they will select Kenya’s representatives for next season’s CAF Champions League. Kamura is confident the quality in the side is good enough to play compete against Africa’s best but the players must first unite as a team and fight to qualify. “We will take game by game and now that we have two matches in hand compared to leaders Tusker, we just need to win all our matches before June 30 and we will be assured of the top position. “We are taking every match as a final and this season we are putting all our resources in it and nothing less,” the Leopards captain said. Kamura, who has served Leopards team since 2017, has cleared the air after some players missed the clash against Nzoia Sugar which they won 1-0 win at Ruaraka Grounds. “My reason to not play the Nzoia match was simply because I was serving a two matches suspension due to a red card. Also Read: “The first match I missed was against Vihiga and the Nzoia one was the second, meaning that I did not snub that match if I may put that clear”. Assistant captain Isaac Kipyegon has also added his voice saying that one of the reasons some players were not present on Saturday is that they are nursing injuries but all will be well as they eye the 2020-21 glory. “Others are out because they are nursing injuries now that you know after we were recalled for training and resumption of league we had been away for a very long time and so some were caught up by muscle hitches but I am sure by next weekend we will be full house. We are taking a match at a time as we move on,” the former Zoo FC defender said. Ingwe are second on 32 points and are well placed to overthrow leaders Tusker should they win their two games in hand.
