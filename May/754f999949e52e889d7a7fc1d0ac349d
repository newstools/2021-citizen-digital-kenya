All eyes have been directed to the new Chief Justice Martha Koome over the leadership tussle in Wajir County. Embattled Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud on Tuesday called leaders from the county to order maintaining that he is still in office. “I continue to be in office to execute powers and functions of governor of Wajir County,” Mohamud told journalists. On Monday, a High Court sitting in Meru gave the governor a sigh of relief ordering that an even judge bench be constituted by the Chief Justice to adjudicate on the matter. “”It is hereby directed that the matter be heard by more than one judge and it shall henceforth be dealt with after the Chief Justice exercises mandate under articles 165(4) of the Constitution,” the orders read. Judge Patrick Otieno of Meru High Court also directed that court orders issued on May 18, 2021, remain in force. Also Read: In the orders issued, the Meru High court noted that previous court orders were disregarded. Addressing a press conference from the Council of Governors headquarters, Governor Mohamud warned that the current leadership wrangles could trigger inter clan tensions and called on Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to beef up security in the region. Ahmed Mukhtar, who was sworn in as Governor last week, on the other hand insists that he is legally in office. CJ Martha Koome is yet to appoint a bench to hear the matter.
