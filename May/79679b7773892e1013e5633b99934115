The Attorney General has filed a notice of appeal against the High Court judgement that declared the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) Bill unconstitutional. The AG also filed an application seeking stay orders of the execution of the appeal saying he was dissatisfied with the judgement. In court papers filed in court and seen by Citizen Digital, the AG claimed he will suffer prejudice if the stay orders are not granted. Through Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto, the AG said no prejudice will be occasioned to the petitioners in the event the Court of Appeal stays the judgement of the orders issued on Thursday. “…the 1st respondent will suffer prejudice as the applicants will proceed to execute the orders rendering the appeal nugatory and causing not only the 1st respondent but also the citizens of Kenya at large irreparable harm,” read court papers. In a 16-paged document, the Solicitor General has filed the application for stay under a certificate of urgency saying that due to the immense public interest, it is in the interest of justice for the Court of Appeal to stay the implementation of the orders pending hearing and determination of the case.
