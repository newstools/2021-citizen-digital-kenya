Over 700 Kenyans have applied to fill the four vacant positions in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), the selection panel for the commissioners has said. The chairperson of the Selection Panel Dr. Elizabeth Muli, in a press address on Tuesday, said the deadline for sending applications was Monday and now they will collate them and publish the names of the applicants. “We will now collate all the applicants and publish in the Kenya Gazette, two leading national newspapers and on the Parliamentary Service Commission website,” said Dr. Muli. She added that owing to the huge number of applicants, it will take a while to sort those who applied manually and electronically and that they would publish the list by Monday next week. “We will thereafter do the shortlisting and publish the names of those who would have been shortlisted, we will also require Kenyans to send memoranda on those that would be selected,” Dr. Muli said. The 7-member selection panel had given itself tight timelines, and the Chairperson insists they intend to keep them as the issue they are dealing with is urgent.

As per the timelines given by the panel, they are to start the shortlisting exercise and will publish the list of the candidates on or about May 24, 2021; an exercise that is supposed to take 7 days for any Kenyan to send views on the shortlisted candidates. The interviews for the shortlisted candidates will be conducted for five days from May 31 to June 4, a timeline the panel however noted could slightly vary given the number of candidates. The panel hopes to settle on the successful candidates and forward the names to President Uhuru Kenyatta on or about June 9, 2021.
