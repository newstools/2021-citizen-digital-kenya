Kariobangi Sharks head coach William Muluya is confident that his charges are ready to tussle for the league title to the wire when it resumes on Wednesday. Muluya has predicted that all the top eight teams have the ability to win the FKF-PL 2020-21 crown at the end of the term. “Those matches coming thick and quick should give us an opportunity to move close to leaders so as to pile pressure at the top. Even if we are not leaders, we should not give leaders a breathing space which means when they make a plus we should also do the same,” Muluya said, adding that, “Any team in the region of top eight, be it Tusker, KCB, AFC Leopards, Bandari, Sofapaka, is capable of running away with the trophy this season.” The soft spoken, youthful tactician has revealed that his boys, led by the league’s top scorer Eric Kapaito, who has so far 14 goals, are in good shape to lock horns with visitors Kakamega Homeboyz in the mid-week fixture. “We have prepared ourselves very well since the boys have been training individually, from home, before we started team-training a week ago. Also Read: We are ready to play, apart from the few who are ruled out because of various reasons, like Samuel Olwande is injured and underwent a minor leg surgery. Patrick Otieno is also not ready because of his injury and there are a few others who are close to return,”Muluya concluded. Sharks are fourth-placed on 28 points, eight behind leaders Tusker but may cut the gap to five with win over Homeboyz thanks to their game in hand. They have won eight matches, drawn four and lost only three in the 15 matches they have played, prior to the ban on sports by the government due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Video Of The Day: Guns galore
