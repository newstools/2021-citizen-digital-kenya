Jubilee has come out to dismiss reports that outspoken politician David Murathe resigned as the ruling party Vice Chair. According to the party, the resignation reports which flooded social media on Wednesday are false as Murathe continues to occupy his seat in the same capacity and perform his duties. “It has come to our attention that there are reports circulating on social media alleging that the Jubilee Party Vice Chair, Hon. David Murathe, has resigned,” read a statement to newsrooms from Jubilee Communications Director  Abert Memusi. “We would like to clarify that such reports are false. Hon. David Murathe remains our able Vice Chair and continues to carry out his duties in that capacity, working diligently to fulfill his mandate as provided for in the Party Constitution.” The party further urged its supporters to treat such further reports with contempt since any changes in the party leadership structure will be communicated by the relevant organs. Jubilee, according to the Communications Director, is at present focused on delivering to Kenyans and completing its tenure as the ruling party. Also Read: “We urge members of the public to treat any documents, reports or communication purporting to convey his resignation with the contempt they deserve,” stated Memusi. “Any official communication about changes in the Jubilee Party leadership will be communicated through the official Party organs, as is the norm, and as is articulated in the Jubilee Party Constitution.” He further added: “We would also like to clarify that the Party is unequivocally focused on fulfilling the pledges made to the people of Kenya, and completing the journey of transformation.” Video Of The Day: | SUCCESS AND AFTER | Tracking the progress made by students who topped KCSE in past years
