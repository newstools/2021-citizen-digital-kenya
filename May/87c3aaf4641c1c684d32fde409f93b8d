A woman from Nandi who is suspected of operating on her 4-year-old son was arrested at her hide out on Saturday evening. Reports indicate that the 35-year old cut her son’s belly so she could collect money from well wishers in the guise that he needed a kidney transplant. According to Kipture Location Chief Cleophas Bunei, the suspect identified as Irene Chemutai fled after she realised that her child was unconscious. The boy was also left bleeding profusely from the wound that was inflicted on him at his home in Kaboen village, Kapsabet Division. Bunei said that the child is currently undergoing treatment at the Kapsabet County Referral and is out of danger. “Chemutai is expected to appear in court once police clear their investigations,” he said.
