Attorney General Kihara Kariuki has withdrawn an application that sought to have the judgement on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) stayed pending determination of the appeal case. His application for a stay had been certified as urgent by a five-judge bench of the High Court. Under the leadership of justice Mumbi Ngugi, the court had indicated that it will give its ruling on the 26th of this month after receiving submissions from both parties. While giving the directions to the parties involved in the matter, the court had earlier on Tuesday directed that applicants should serve their written submissions by close of business this Thursday with the other parties directed to file and serve their submissions by the end of Friday. The AG’s withdrawal is likely to prompt a change in plans by the court. The Attorney General, IEBC and the BBI secretariat have since filed notices of appeal against the High Court ruling.
