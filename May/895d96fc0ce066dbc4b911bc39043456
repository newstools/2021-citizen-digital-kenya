Fredrick Ochieng from Marsabit County is on a mission to traverse 25 counties on a bicycle to create awareness on the Covid-19 pandemic. The 28-year-old man, who is on the phase two of his anti-coronavirus campaign, seeks to cycle from Tana River to Turkana through 23 other counties. These include Kilifi, Mombasa, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Makueni, Kitui, Machakos, Kajiado, Narok, Bomet, Nyamira, Kisii, Migori, Homa Bay, Vihiga, Kakamega, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot. In August last year, Ochieng cycled through 14 counties from Moyale near the Kenya-Ethiopia border, to Busia near the Kenya-Uganda border in 20 days, as the country continues to fight the pandemic. Speaking to journalists in Kitui Town, the father of two said he began the journey on May 10 and expects to complete it by July 16, 2021. He said the initiative was inspired by widespread failure by Kenyans to observe the guidelines laid out by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation.

They no longer wear masks nor wash hands or maintain social distancing which are key in preventing spread of the deadly disease,” he said. Ochieng, whose home county is Siaya, maintained that he will not tire to remind Kenyans about the disease that has ravaged families, the economy and the health system, and ways to alleviate its spread. He, however, noted that the journey was not without its challenges as he was forced to leave his family behind to take up the mission. “Lack of funds to cater for my upkeep and accommodation along the way has also been a major challenge but I thank Kenyans of goodwill for their support so far,” he added before proceeding to Machakos County.
