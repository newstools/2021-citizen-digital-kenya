National women’s volleyball team captain Mercy Moim has urged the squad to remain focused despite the cancellation of their trip to train in Brazil. Malkia Strikers were scheduled to have a high-performance training camp in Sao Paulo, for a period of six weeks, but the Government cancelled the trip citing the alarming Covid-19 situation in Brazil. Moim, who will lead the team back to the Olympic Games after a 16-year hiatus, says the recent setback will not take them off rails. “We would’ve gained a lot in Brazil but that is water under the bridge… I remain focused and so is the squad,” she told Citizen Digital. The nine-time African champions’ skipper however urged the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) and the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) to look for another alternative to help the team fine-tune their skills before jetting out for July 23 to August 8 Games. This comes after officials in Turkey cancelled the team’s plans to train in the Southeast Europe nation due to Covid-19 challenges.
