Limuru Member of Parliament Peter Mwathi has been elected unopposed to chair the powerful National Security and Administration Committee, replacing the late Kiambaa lawmaker Paul Koinange. Mwathi, who is new to the committee, comes in after the intervention of the Jubilee party as well as Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga. Wajir Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi was eyeing the post but failed to return her nomination papers after Raila’s intervention. “The fact that the Prime Minister told me his preferred candidate for this position is Mwathi and that he has communicated to the President, and with the respect I have for Raila, it ended there,” Gedi told members of the committee. She said the fact that she was serving in the Budget and Appropriations Committee besides Jubilee’s preference of Mwathi taking over also made her change her mind. Mwathi has served in different House committees and was previously the Chair of the Labor and Social Services Committee before being moved to the Security Committee. Also Read: Mwathi, while thanking his party and the membership of the committee for having trust in him to lead, promised to do all he can to take it forward. “Koinange has left some big shoes, I can only try and fit in them, and that with your assistance and your support we will be able to move the agenda that we have, the agenda that was outstanding, and the agenda that will come, and not only that but that we will be able to oversight because that is our role,” Mwathi said. Mwathi is counting on the membership’s support to bring him up to date with what the committee was handling and says he doesn’t foresee any resistance from the membership of the committee despite being a new member.
