Police in Nyando, Kisumu County, have arrested three people suspected to be behind the theft of over 17,000 mosquito nets meant for free distribution to families in the area by the national government to curb the spread of malaria. The nets were given by the government with support from the Global Fund to cushion families, especially those in the flood-prone areas, from mosquito attacks. Kisumu County Police Commander Samuel Anampiu said 181 bales were missing from Nyang’ande hospital and another 160 from Rabuor hospital with each bale containing 50 nets. Anampiu said police moved in and arrested Theresa Anyango Otieno, who is the acting officer in charge at Rabuor sub-county hospital; Cynthia Akinyi, the acting officer in charge of net distribution at Nyang’ande area; and David Ouma, the officer in charge at Nyang’ande hospital. The police boss added that they are still looking for two more suspects, namely Dickson Malit who is stationed at Rabuor sub-county hospital but is currently on study leave, as well as one Samuel Omino. There have been several complaints this week from hundreds of locals who had turned up for the distribution of the free nets but were turned away in most health facilities in Nyando, similar complaints were also registered in Nyakach and Kisumu west sub-counties.
