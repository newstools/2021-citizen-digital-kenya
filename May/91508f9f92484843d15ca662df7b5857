Foreign investors continued to exit the domestic stock market in April culminating in a net selling position of Ksh.32.3 million ($0.3 million) during the month. The sell-off position however contracted sharply from Ksh.958.5 million ($8.9 million) in March. The continued exit of foreign investors from the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is largely attributable to the depressed macroeconomic environment as the country feels the heat of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. The extended sell-offs which now total Ksh.990.8 million ($9.2 million) in the year to date has been matched by declining activity at the NSE. For instance, Equity turnover in April declined by 16.8 per cent to Ksh.9.8 billion from Ksh.11.8 billion in March.

In the year so far, NASI and the NSE 25 index have marked gains of 11.3 and 7.8 per cent respectively while the NSE 20 index has marked marginal losses of 0.3 per cent.
