Deputy President William Ruto’s first-born daughter June Ruto officially tied the knot on Thursday. June tied the knot to her Nigerian sweetheart Dr. Alexander Ezenagu at a lavish ceremony held at the DP’s official residence in Karen, Nairobi. She was walked down the aisle by her parents Mama Rachel Ruto and DP Ruto, who earlier in the morning attended and addressed the National Prayer Breakfast at State House. The DP was dressed in a black suit and white shirt, matching bowtie compounded with a cowboy hat; while Mama Rachel wore a pink dress. The bride, on her part, strutted the aisle in a simple white off-shoulder wedding dress. The ceremony was attended by, among others, DP Ruto’s allies including Senators Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho), and Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), Nandi Governor Stephen Sang, and Soy MP Caleb Kositany.
