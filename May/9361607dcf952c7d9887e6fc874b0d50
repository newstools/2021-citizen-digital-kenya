The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) is probing the alleged illegal acquisition of properties worth a reported Ksh.11.5 billion by three former governors and one who is currently still in office. The four are; Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal and former county bosses Evans Kidero (Nairobi), Mike Sonko (Nairobi) as well as Ferdinand Waititu (Kiambu). This is according to EACC Chairman Eliud Wabukala who spoke on Tuesday when he appeared before the Senate Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. Wabukala also revealed that the commission had seized assets worth Ksh.25 billion stolen from the public over the last five years. At the same time, the Wabukala further stated that EACC had presented the loss of over Ksh.30 billion during the same 5-year period. He added that the commission has probed 1,000 corruption cases, with 269 of them being prosecuted in courts.

He however cited budgetary constraints, politicization of the fight against graft, and unethical conduct besides a weak legal framework as some of the barriers hindering the commission’s work.
