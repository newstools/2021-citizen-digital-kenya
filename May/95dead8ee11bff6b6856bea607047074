Police in Mombasa are searching for a robbery with violence suspect who escaped from custody while being presented in court on Monday. The suspect; Ngalaa Hassan, who is facing charges of assault and robbery with violence in Likoni, fled by jumping over the Mombasa Law Court’s fence after his bail was revoked. Hassan, who was out on bail, had been re-arrested and presented in court on Monday for failing to attend court sessions, forcing the judge to revoke his bail. After the ruling setting aside his bail was delivered, the suspect is reported to have requested to visit the washrooms for a call of nature. He was escorted to the toilets’ entrance where he was uncuffed and allowed to proceed into the facilities. Shortly later, the accused stormed out of the toilet and shoved to the ground the police officer who was waiting at the door. Attempts by the police officer to raise an alarm and fire at the suspect were futile as the suspect had already managed to escape. The accused jumped over the fence and disappeared into the neighborhood. Also Read: Video Of The Day: | SUCCESS AND AFTER | Tracking the progress made by students who topped KCSE in past years
