Ongare’s sanguinity is anchored on the quality preparations so far, noting the one-week championship will be vital in assessing the form against international boxers, of the class they expect to fight during the Olympics. “I don’t want to just participate. I want to write a legacy as well, one that will motivate emerging female boxers. There is nothing impossible with hard work and trust in God, no matter where you go, no matter what kind of life you have been through. “The championship in Russia motivates and prepares me better. I believe during the Olympics I will not come back home empty-handed, I cannot declare it will be a gold medal but I must step on the podium,” said Ongare.

Since we came from Zone 3 we have been practicing well and we can’t say we have weaknesses, we are fine. The Congolese competition compensated well for the league which has been stopped for long due to Covid-19. Thus, in Russia we do not see any physical difficulties, we are more stable,” said Akinyi.
