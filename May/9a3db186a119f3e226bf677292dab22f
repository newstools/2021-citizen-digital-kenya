The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) services accessed through the TIMS portal will be unavailable from Thursday 5pm to Monday May 31, 2021. The authority, in a public statement, said this is to allow for upgrade and system maintenance as part of a general service improvement strategy. These NTSA services currently available through TIMS include smart DL booking/enrollment, PDL, test booking applications, collection of logbooks and number plates. The services will be temporarily inaccessible on the NTSA website ( www.ntsa.go.ke) as well as the mobile application and the contact centre. “Collection of Smart Driving Licences at various centers and services on the Revamped TIMS – timsvirl.ntsa.go.ke – (transfer of ownership, inspection booking, asset financing in-charge/discharge, application for change of particulars, duplicate logbook, reflective number plates among others) will be available to the public,” said the authority in the statement. “We do acknowledge this impacts you and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused. For service support, contact the Authority through info@ntsa.go.ke and NTSA social media platforms.” Also Read: Video Of The Day: | SUCCESS AND AFTER | Tracking the progress made by students who topped KCSE in past years
