Comedy of errors cost Kenya Sevens Rugby team yet another loss in the Rugby Africa Solidarity Sevens final match played in Stellenbosch, South Africa. A comfortable 31-5 score-line in favour of South Africa was enough as the Boks cemented their dominance over Kenya. It was the third straight loss for Shujaa to the South Africans in the Solidarity camp tournament. In a final with a number of errors by Shujaa saw the Innocent Simiyu coached side succumb to the pressure by the Boks attackers. The Neil Powell coached side scored their first try through Makata Sako with Justin Geduld adding the second try soon after restart. Shujaa tried to score one just before the break but veteran Winger Collins Injera could not hold on Billy Odhiambo’s pass as score-line remained 12-0 in favour of South Africa heading to the interval’s. Also Read: Soon after the break, South Africa would showcase a clinical set piece which saw Kenya defence split with Angelo Davids scoring in the far corner – 19-0 score-line. Angelo would be at it again with a superb kick and chase to stretch the lead beyond Shujaa reach with only two minutes left to play. Shujaa would score a consolation try through Homeboyz RFC forward Alvin Otieno’s. However, a last minute defence lapse saw Muller du Preez score the last try of the day to seal the deserved win of 31-5. Kenyan team will jet back tomorrow with preparations in earnest ahead of the final tournament – quest for Gold 7s set for June 25-26 in Los Angeles.
