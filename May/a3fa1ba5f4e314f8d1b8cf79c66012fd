The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party and its leader Raila Odinga have no intention of kicking out Siaya Senator James Orengo from his position as Leader of Minority in the Senate. This is according to a statement sent to newsrooms on Wednesday evening by Raila’s spokesman Dennis Onyango. Mr. Onyango, in the statement, rubbished rumors of a plot in the works to change the minority leadership in the Senate. This comes following the removal of Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo from the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly which he served as Vice Chair. “Following changes effected yesterday to the representation of the Orange Democratic Movement in the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, there has been unfounded and widespread speculation that the Party is about to change its Minority leadership in the Senate,” said Mr. Onyango. “We wish to clarify that Rt. Hon Raila Odinga, the ODM Party Leader and the Orange Democratic Movement have no plans to replace Senator James Orengo as the Leader of Minority in the Senate.” Also Read: Video Of The Day: Guns galore
