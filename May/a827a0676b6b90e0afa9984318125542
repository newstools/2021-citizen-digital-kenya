Gor Mahia coach Manuel Vaz Pinto says they will give maximum concentration to both competitions – the FKF Cup and FKF-PL as they hunt for a slot to continental football. Speaking after guiding his charges past Congo Boys FC in an FKF Cup round of 64 match played at the Mbaraki Sports Club in Mombasa, Vaz Pinto said they will try to win the FKF Cup as well as the league which he termed as ‘still wide open’. “We are working very hard to make sure we clinch both the League and the Cup,” said Vaz Pinto. Gor will meet little-known CUSCO next week, in a round of 32 tie. K’Ogalo who are sixth on the league table will be back in action on Thursday when they tackle Vihiga United at the Mumias Sports Complex, a win moving them to position five on the table with Vaz Pinto optimistic that they will extend their winning streak. “The league is still much open and we have won four games in a row, we want to continue with the good work.” Also Read: Football Kenya Federation issued a directive on selection of Kenyan representative to the CAF Champions League, with the league leader by 30th June gaining the ticket automatically.
