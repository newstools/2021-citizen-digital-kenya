Two Nigerian nationals charged with trafficking narcotic drugs and being in Kenya unlawfully have written a letter to the Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI) George Kinoti seeking to have their phones released. The two; Solomon Nduba Abuzike and Cletus Okeke Onyabuch, through their lawyer Elkana Musyoki, want the DCI to direct the DCIO Makuyu Police Station to obey the court order that released them on bail. They want their mobile phones released immediately to enable them call their relatives. The two have been in custody since April 19 this year and were transferred to Nyeri Maximum Prison for purposes of quarantine for a period of 14 days. They claim that although they were granted bail, they have been unable to secure their freedom since they don’t have their phones to reach their families. The two allege that the DCIO Makuyu has been in possession of the mobile phones for 36 days now and has never taken any action on the same.
