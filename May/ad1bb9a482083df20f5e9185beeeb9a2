A Nairobi Court has denied former rugby player Alex Olaba’s bail application, ordering that he remain in custody until a gang rape case against him is heard and decided. The court stated in its ruling on Monday that interfering with witnesses is not something to be taken lightly. Mr. Olaba pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to murder charges in the same court last week. He entered a not guilty plea before Magistrate Francis Andayi and was remanded in custody for seven days pending the outcome of his bail application. The former player, who is on trial for gang rape, was arrested on suspicion of hiring a hit man to assassinate a key witness in the ongoing case. Olaba made many attempts, both directly and indirectly, to contact key witnesses in the case in order to sway its outcome, according to the investigating officer. Also Read: He was arrested at Madaraka estate, according to the police report, while attending a meeting whose agenda included the elimination of a key witness in the gang rape case he is facing. To get to the bottom of the charges, detectives working on the case performed a forensic examination of his phone. At the time, the prosecutor demanded that he be held for ten days until the investigation was completed. He also allegedly missed his last court appearance and told the judge he was in Bungoma, according to the prosecution. On the other hand, the defense lawyer objected to the 10-day arrest, arguing that his client has a medical condition. While requesting that the suspect be transferred to a less crowded police station, preferably Capitol Hill Police Station, the defense also requested that the suspect be granted reasonable bail terms, arguing that he was neither a flight risk nor a court session absconder. In its ruling, the court stated that the prosecution had established sufficient grounds for his detention, allowing police to detain him for seven days at Kilimani Police Station while investigations continue.
