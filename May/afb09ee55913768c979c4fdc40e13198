AFC Leopards head coach Patrick Aussems has hailed defender Clyde Senaji for rejoining the team for the FKF-PL clash against Posta Rangers after an’ in-depth’ conversation with him last week. Senaji was among the players that had gone AWOL missing Ingwe’s 1-0 win over Nzoia United but made a return on Saturday against Rangers and despite the match ending in a barren draw, Aussems maintained that he will work with the players available for selection. “You know I have had a conversation with Senaji last week although the other players we were talking about have not yet availed themselves, perhaps I will see them in the training tomorrow(Monday) though I’m not sure at all. As I told you, I will work with the players who are at my disposal and I can tell you they are doing a good job,”Aussems said. The Belgian has however accused match-day officials of not doing their job as expected. “As I said, one point when you play 10 against 15, its good. This is because we didn’t play against 11 players of Posta Rangers but we also played against the pitch and against three men who were wearing yellow jerseys which is not easy,” he charged.

With a game in hand, Leopards now sit third on 33 points, three shy of leaders KCB while Tusker dropped to second position on 35 points.
