AFC Leopards hierarchy has called for a crisis meeting on Monday to deliberate on actions to impose on players who gave the Nzoia Sugar clash on Saturday a wide berth, Chairman Dan Shikanda has said. Dependable players; captain Robinson Kamura, international defender Cylde Senaji, Marvin Nabwire, Collins Sichenje and Burundian Bienvenue Shaka were notably missing at Ruaraka grounds and the Leopards boss has reprimanded some of them for indiscipline. “Some of them have been signed by foreign teams for greener pastures while others are going…..we are have a meeting today to talk about this situation because for some of them it’s lack of discipline and alcoholism,” Shikanda claimed, adding that, “Let us first of all meet today(Monday) and then we shall issue a statement on what we shall have decided on.” Head coach Patrick Aussems was also not pleased by the action take by the quartet terming it unprofessional. “I don’t know for which reasons(that they disappeared without any permission), and so for me those are not professional players. You can’t leave your team like that and let your teammates down in that manner, and then maybe come back in three or four days and say okay, I’m back…No…No, it’s not behavior of professional football players,” Aussems fumed.
