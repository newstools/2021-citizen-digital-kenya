Janet, who is also the author of a book My First Time, describes Sulwe as a magical and poignant story about a little girl who struggles to love herself because of how she looks and how that makes her feel. “She goes on a magical journey of self discovery and comes back to love her self and love the skin she’s in. My sons, Huru and Mali, absolutely love the story and it has, of late, become our go-to night time reading. It has lessons for us all but more than that, the fantasy and magical experience is really captivating,” she added.

But it is so important that amidst that, you are able to bestow it on yourself, first and foremost, because then you can bolster yourself up to challenge the world,” she told Oprah Winfrey. I loved my reading of #Sulwe with @OfficialJMbugua today. What a wonderful moderator she is! And I loved wearing these gorgeous @YalaJewellery earrings for it.
