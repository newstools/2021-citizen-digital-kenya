PwC has released the seventh edition of its Africa Value Added Tax guide, comprising updates on VAT regimes in 41 African countries. PwC’s 2021 Africa VAT Guide highlights compliance-related initiatives such as the adoption of real-time VAT reporting and data analysis by various tax administrations to shore up their collections. “The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other developments on the continent have caused a rapid shift to virtual, remote operations and new ways of working,” said Job Kabochi, PwC Africa’s Indirect Tax Leader. “Through this publication, we’re looking ahead and preparing for the future. This report includes insight on the emerging technology ecosystem in Africa – as well as other, more traditional aspects of VAT regimes in each country,” he added. With the theme of ‘Moving towards a united Africa’, this edition is focused on Africa’s journey into the future and how different countries’ VAT regimes help to shape that journey. The guide has been compiled by PwC indirect tax experts with hands-on experience in each of the 41 countries represented in the report.

Accordingly, we have given special attention to the taxation of cross-border supply of both goods and services in this edition of the Africa VAT Guide,” he said. Many African governments are prioritising enhanced compliance as a way to address tax revenue shortfalls and protect the existing tax base.
