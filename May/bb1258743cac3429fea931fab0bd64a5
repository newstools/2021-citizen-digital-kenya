Kenya Rugby Sevens head coach Innocent ‘Namcos’ Simiyu says his focus is to work on their mistakes over the weekend after finishing second in the Stellenbosch Solidarity Camp tourney losing 31-07 to host South Africa, as they race to be in top shape ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. South Africa scored five tries, converting three while Shujaa scored a converted try. On their way to the finals Shujaa defeated neighbours Uganda 24- 07, Stellenbosch Academy of Sport 26-00, Zimbabwe 24-00 before losing 27-14 to South Africa in the group stages. And according to Simiyu, his charges will work harder to improve on their weak areas before the weekend matches. “It’s a big step for us and we’ve identified areas to address before our next tournament this weekend in S.A, we will focus on our kickoff reception, ball movement and tackle completion ahead of the tourney,” said Simiyu. Shujaa lost only two matches against South Africa over the weekend and the former skipper believes his team will overcome their rivals.

Simiyu lauded Rugby Africa for the tournament which he termed as ‘competitive’ adding that it will sharpen more on their team skills ahead of the Olympics. “It’s good to be out here playing rugby and to get some good competition from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Uganda, we’re happy with the games but very unfortunate to lose against S.A who were a bit more clinical than us but we’re focusing on our next assignment this weekend,” said Simiyu. Innocent ‘Namcos’ Simiyu charges are using the camp to prepare for the Tokyo Olympics with the camp expected to continue this weekend. Video Of The Day: Guns galore
