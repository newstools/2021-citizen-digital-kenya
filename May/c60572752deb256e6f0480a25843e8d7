Gor Mahia’s vice-captain Philemon Otieno says they are under no pressure to finish top of the FKF Premier League by June 30 for a chance to represent the country in next season’s CAF Champions League. According to Otieno, their target is to win every match ahead of them and avoid concentrating on their rivals’ performance. “We are taking a match at a time with a target of winning in every outing. Our interest is not how our rivals are performing. We are hopeful of making it to the continental level for the fifth year running,’’ said Otieno. Gor edged Sofapaka FC 2-1 on Thursday in Wundanyi and will remain at the coast through to Sunday when they are due to face Division One side Congo Boys in a rescheduled round of 64 FKF Cup clash at Mbaraki Stadium. “We have congestion of fixtures. After Congo Boys we travel to play Vihiga United away in a mid-week fixture. We are set for all matches,” he said. Otieno said the team is focused on making a mark despite a few challenges occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic.
