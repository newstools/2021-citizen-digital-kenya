A petition has been filed at the Milimani Law Courts seeking to have the government directed to provide free sanitary towels to girls in public schools. The petitioner, lawyer Elvis Begi Nyachiro Abenga, argues that the State is providing free condoms in every public institution, adding that if that is feasible, then there is no absolute reason why the State cannot provide the sanitary towels to school going children. “The provision of sanitary towels to school girls is essential to upholding their inherent right to human dignity respected and protected,” reads court documents. He argues that as a result of lack of sanitary towels, more than 60% of girls in impoverished homes and areas in Kenya miss schooling during their menses, in addition to suffering from gross indignity. “A declaration does issue that the State’s providence of male condoms is sufficient evidence to show that resources are available and that the State has no defense under Article 20 of the 2010 constitution,” reads the papers. Justice Makau has directed that the application be served to the respondents and that the respondents do file and serve their responses to the application before the next mention date.
