Vihiga United will get it rough to survive relegation should their financial struggles persist, says their immediate former head coach Sammy Okoth. Okoth who resigned a week ago has asserted that should the status remain the same at the Vihiga county-based team, then they will be nearing the axe from the top tier league. “If things won’t change then it will be very hard for them to avoid relegation this season. However, I believe that maybe my resignation will make the management perhaps start paying players their salaries, availability of facilities and in general, enabling players to train without complaining then it may be different if not, it will be very hard,” Sammy said. According to the former Zoo FC tactician, there is no team that can pose excellent performances without passion, togetherness and financial stability in the playing unit and the coaching staff. “The running of the league entails people to have passion, closer to their team, team funding without any problem to inject comfortability in players for better performances. Any team that is surrounded with excuses for not paying coaches or players, performance will never be good,” Okoth added. Having gone through Zoo FC, Karuturi, KRA, Oserian FC and Vihiga United in his coaching journey, Okoth unearths how hard and challenging it has been coaching without money in Kenyan football.

You will realize that all the teams worldwide when you see them at the bottom of the league or closer, it reflects their lack of money to motivate the players,” Okoth concluded. Vihiga United are 15th on the log with 12 points, only four above bottom-placed Mathare United.
