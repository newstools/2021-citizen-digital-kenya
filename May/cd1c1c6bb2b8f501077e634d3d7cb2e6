Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta says he will prove himself worthy of his position after a “devastating” exit to Villarreal in the Europa League. The Gunners were unable to find a way past a determined Villarreal in their semi-final second leg, drawing 0-0 at the Emirates and ultimately exiting the Europa League 2-1 on aggregate. It is another bitter blow in a below-par season for Arsenal. They face the prospect of no European football next season for the first time in 25 years and are currently ninth in the Premier League table. The questions have already begun regarding Arteta’s future at the club following a disappointing campaign, but is adamant he is the right man for the job. When asked if he was the right man to pick his players up, Arteta said: “I wouldn’t be sitting here if I couldn’t. You will see it. It’s not about talking, it’s about showing it on the pitch. “I feel the pressure all the time because I want to do as good as I can for the team, for every support that I have here and for the fans. Today is a big disappointment because we tried everything to be in that final.
