Shock has descended on Swahili village in Ruring’u, Nyeri county, following the discovery of a one-day-old baby dumped in a pit latrine. According to neighbours who spoke to the media, one of the Swahili village residents had gone for a bathroom break when they heard a baby crying. “One of the neighbours went for a bathroom break in the morning when they heard a baby crying; on inspection, they discovered a baby had been dumped into the toilet,” a resident told Citizen Digital. Residents notified the area chief and requested assistance from the police and county firefighters in rescuing the baby. The concrete slab made retrieval efforts especially difficult, but the baby was rescued by mid-morning on Sunday. The infant is currently being treated at the Nyeri Provincial General Hospital while efforts to locate the mother continue. Although her name was not immediately released to the media, residents say the infant’s mother moved into the neighborhood about three months ago and hawks smokies within the town.
