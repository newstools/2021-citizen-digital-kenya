Five gangsters were killed earlier this week in a shoot-out with detectives from the elite Special Service Unit (SSU). According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the miscreants who were armed to the teeth were on a robbery mission in Kakamega, before they were gunned down. “The gangsters were flagged down at Makhokho but they defied the order and resorted to shooting at the detectives indiscriminately. However, their feeble attack was no match to the detectives’ hail of gunfire that immobilized them within seconds, leaving all of them fatally injured,” the DCI said on Twitter. SSU detectives who were acting on intelligence, had trailed the suspects on the Kakamega-Kisumu road on Tuesday. The DCI said the five-man gang that was traveling in a silver Toyota Belta vehicle had also planned to commit a series of other robberies in Bungoma and Mumias towns, before their mission was cut short. Two firearms were reportedly recovered from the suspects including a mini ceska CZ75, loaded with 6 rounds of 9mm calibre.
