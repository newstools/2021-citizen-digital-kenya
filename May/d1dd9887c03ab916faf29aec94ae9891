Bandari FC head coach Andre Casa Mbungo believes wasted chances is to blame for their 1-1 draw with Bidco United in their first FKF Premier League match, played at the weekend, since the lifting of the ban on sports, Veteran striker Stephen Waruru opened the scoring for the visitors in the second half through a penalty, but a few minutes later, William Wadri grabbed the equaliser, also from the spot, to ensure for shared spoils but coach Mbungo is far from impressed, noting that the final score does not reflect the real picture on the ground as they had a lot of chances to claim the match bragging rights but his strikers lethargy is to blame. “We can say we have dropped two points rather than collect one because we had everything to win this match only for our strikers to deny us maximum points,” he lamented. At the same time the Rwandan tactician mentioned lack of match fitness as another reason for their slow restart after sports were suspended countrywide for almost two months. Missing out three first team players who are out sick also added to the Dockers problems but Mbungo is optimistic they will be ready for their next two away matches. “After being out for long we struggled like any other side, but that is not an excuse because we created chances,” he explained. “Siraj, Yema and Mulumba who missed this(Bidco) match will hopefully travel with us in our next matches against KCB and Western Stima.” Also Read: On his part, Bidco United coach Moses Akhulia was grateful for a point gained away at the Coast, but also decried lack of fitness due to the long sports suspension. “It is a plus for us earning a point away in Mombasa because it is not easy to get one,” explained Akhulia. As per the drafted fixture released last week, Bandari who are fifth on the log, will play KCB on Sunday 23rd May at Kasarani while tenth placed Bidco will have a long rest before tackling AFC Leopards as they were scheduled to play relegated Zoo.
