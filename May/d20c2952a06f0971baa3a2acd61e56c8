Congo Boys FC assistant coach Abdul Nasser Kassim says his side is ready to put up a brave fight when they host Gor Mahia FC during Sunday’s round of 64 FKF Cup match at Mbaraki Grounds in Mombasa. Gor are the overwhelming favourites in the clash that has been postponed twice over the last six months due to the Kenyan champions’ continental cup commitments and COVID-19 challenges. “We are ready and have nothing to lose so let them (Gor) come and beat us if they can,” Kassim said. Congo Boys face a brutal weekend schedule as they are due to play Division One rivals Naivas in a league game the day earlier on Saturday, but Kassim has vowed they won’t yield to Gor. The Division One league will be resuming on Saturday since sports suspension countrywide to contain the spread of Covid-19. “Playing two matches in two days is not Ok but we must honour them because our match against Gor has been postponded several times and the federation is having a headache on the fixtures”.
