Former Harambee Stars striker Boniface Ambani has urged FKF Premier League strikers to maintain consistency in scoring if they have to beat his record of 26 goals in a single season. The former AFC Leopards  and Tusker Fc striker said the Kenyan top-flight league does not have marksmen that can perform in back to back seasons, shining in one season and struggling during the next. “During my time I could win the golden boot but whenever I missed it I would either be second or third in the race. That happened consistently because of the hard work and the vision of becoming a better player than I was during the previous season,” Ambani said. Only Allan Wanga has come close to breaking the mark, when he scored 23 goals on his debut season in the top flight in 2007, while also playing for Tusker but Ambani believes his record that has stood for 13 years could be broken as soon as this season if Elvis Rupia of Leopards and his Kariobangi Sharks counterpart Eric Kapaito can keep their form until the end of the season. Kapaito has already found the back of the net 14 times and Rupia is on three behind on 11 goals at the midway point of the season. “That kind of close competition for the golden boot is a good thing for the league because they can push each other to the very end and end scoring loads of goals. They are both aware a place in the national team is also at stake. Their momentum might be affected because of the league stoppage but they can still do it.
