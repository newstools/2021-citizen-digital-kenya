Education CS George Magoha has said schools that have opened for the 2020 third term on Monday will close on July 10, 2021. Prof. Magoha said schools will start a new calendar year after the one-week break in a bid to make up for the time lost during the prolonged closure last year. “We deliberately created a tight academic calendar that enables us to accelerate completion of school terms. The new year entails the rollout of the Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) Grade 5. For avoidance of doubt, we shall all roll out grade 5 together; whether you are in private or public schools. There is only one government,” he said. The Education CS was speaking on Monday during the release of results for the 2020 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam. Prof. Magoha announced that there will be five examinations this year while candidates for the 2021 KCSE and Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams will sit for their papers in March next year. “In December 2022 we will administer another examination. Hopefully I will not be there, but we shall have planned for everything so that those who take over from us will have a seamless process. We had tried to avoid this but since we are one country, we must remember that the world is your stage and when you are given a job, you don’t get attached to it. You do what you have to do and ensure that when you leave, whoever takes over can proceed from there,” he said.

He asked the multi-agency team to tighten their belts and prepare to handle the five exams. Video Of The Day: Guns galore
