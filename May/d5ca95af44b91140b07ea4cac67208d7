A 40-year-old man accused of killing his daughter is presently being detained at Ogwedhi police post in Suna West, Migori County. The suspect, identified as Nicholas Odhiambo Magol, was arrested on Tuesday morning after his 15-year-old daughter succumbed to injuries inflicted by him. Ogwedhi sub-location Assistant Chief Kennedy Ochanda said the Class Six pupil was assaulted by the suspect on Saturday and got ill for two days before she succumbed. Mr. Ochanda said preliminary investigations indicated that the girl reportedly fled from home on Friday last week before the angry father traced her to her sister’s house in Uriri the following day. Upon returning home on Saturday, the administrator said, the suspect flogged the girl thoroughly leaving her with injuries. She was rushed to a local clinic where she received treatment and was discharged but she, unfortunately, died a day later.
