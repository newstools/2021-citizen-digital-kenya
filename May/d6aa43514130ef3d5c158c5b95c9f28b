The body of a 33 year old man was found inside a saloon car at a petrol station around Otonglo area on the Kisumu Kisian road on Wednesday. It is reported that Habel Oile had parked at the petrol station and night guards noticed he had not alighted from the car for a long period. County police commander Samuel Anampiu said one of the guards walked to the car and when he peeped inside, he saw a man in sleeping position on the front seat. He alerted the police who arrived moments later and broke into the car, only to discover that the man was died. Anampiu said officers found a 25mm bottle of insecticide which they believe the suspect ingested leading to his death. Officers collected the bottle as an exhibit to facilitate investigations.
