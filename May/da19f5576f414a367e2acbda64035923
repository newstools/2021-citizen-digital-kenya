The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has resolved to postpone its planned party grassroots and national elections until 2022 after the General Elections. This is according to the deputy party leader and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya who spoke on Friday after meeting ODM MCAs from Vihiga County. Governor Oparanya stated that conducting the ODM elections only a year to the general polls would only serve to divide the party. He added that the decision was arrived at in a bid to strengthen the party’s internal structure to present a formidable front ahead of the 2022 General Elections. “We have agreed as the National Central Committee that we carry out harmonisation in all our branches and in all our party structures,” said the ODM deputy party leader. “We feel this would be more viable at the moment, because if we did an election near the General Elections then it becomes a problem, many issues arise, and in the process we might divide the party.” Also Read: He further added: “We want to avoid that, so that we carry out party harmonisation and we might now do elections for the party immediately after the General Elections.” Video Of The Day: Guns galore
