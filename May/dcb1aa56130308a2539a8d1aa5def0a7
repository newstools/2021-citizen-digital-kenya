Kakamega HomeBoyz head coach Nickolas Muyoti was impressed with the way his side capitalized on the scoring chances they created against their opponents in the weekend victory against Western Stima. HomeBoyz defeated Stima 4-0 to earn the maximum points and a clean sheet, something Muyoti said has been positive to note since the resumption of the league. “The players capitalized on the chances we created, which is basically what a good team should do. We defended really well and gave our opponents no chance to score. I am really impressed by the improvements we have shown as a team,” said Muyoti. The youth full tactician also noted with pleasure the appointment of Bernard Mwalala as part of their technical bench  saying his experience in the league has added a lot of value in them – improving their attack department where they were struggling in previous matches “His experience in football is both local and regional and that is something he is bringing to the team in addition to mine. We are hoping we will bring the best out of the player as the season goes by,” added Muyoti. HomeBoyz next face Posta Rangers on Friday and the former Kenyan international is hopeful of his side getting maximum points.
