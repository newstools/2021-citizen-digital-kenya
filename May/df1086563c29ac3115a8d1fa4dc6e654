Sofapaka defender Michael Kibwage is warming up for Football Kenya Federation Premier League return so he can work to help the club scale the standings. The 2009 champions have struggled for consistency in the current campaign, managing just five wins, four draws and six losses which leaves them 11th on the table on 19 points. That points tally is 17 shy of what leaders Tusker FC have amassed and while the season is already at the midway point, Kibwage believes Sofapaka still have a chance in the title race. “We want to win matches and take the team to the top where it belongs. Our priority is to win the league and until the final whistle of the season is blown nothing has changed. We are ready to fight,” the Harambee Stars defender told Citizen Digital. On Monday, FKF confirmed in a statement the league would resume on Friday, two weeks after the Government lifted its ban on sports activities over COVID-19 concerns. Seven FKF-PL teams – Tusker, Western Stima, Nairobi City Stars, Kariobangi Sharks, AFC Leopards, Bandari, and Nzoia Sugar – underwent COVID-19 tests on Wednesday ahead of Friday’s restart.
