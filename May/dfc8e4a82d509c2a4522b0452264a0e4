Kakamega Homeboyz FC have roped in former Bandari coach Bernard Mwalala into their technical bench for a one-year deal, ahead of the FKF Premier League restart. Club chairman Cleophas ‘Toto’ Syimanyula said Mwalala was unveiled Wednesday morning, noting they sought his services thanks to his rich experience in the local league. Shimanyula, however, did not reveal the specific position the youthful tactician will hold in the technical bench which former Harambee Stars captain Nicholas Muyoti heads. “We’ve brought him so that he can bolster the technical bench because he is a coach with a lot of experience. Our aim is to finish in a better position this season,” Shimanyula told Citizen Digital. “His role in the technical bench will be announced ‘soon’ but he will work closely with (Nicholas) Muyoti who will continue serving as the head coach.” Mwalala, a lethal Harambee Stars striker in his prime, parted ways with Bandari last year following poor results in the 2019-2020 season.

He also won the FKF Shield and consequently qualified for the CAF Confederation Cup, and went on to propel Bandari to the second round of the competition. By the time the league was suspended after President Uhuru Kenyatta imposed Covid-19 restrictions in March, Homeboyz were lying in position eighth on the 18-team table, just one place below Gor Mahia with 21 points from 16 matches. They are scheduled to take on Kariobangi Sharks at Kasarani on Friday. Video Of The Day: Different journeys, same destiny: The story of top two candidates | KCSE 2020 |
