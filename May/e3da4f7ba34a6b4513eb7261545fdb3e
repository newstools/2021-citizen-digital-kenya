A middle-aged woman, her 5-year-old son, and nanny were on Wednesday evening found dead under mysterious circumstances at Mzee Wanyama area in Nakuru County. The lifeless bodies of the three were discovered at around 5:30pm after a fire reportedly broke out within the living room of the house they were living in, prompting neighbors to rush to the scene. Witnesses who spoke to Citizen Digital said an 18-month-old baby who was trapped in the house was rescued and rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. Neighbors however suspect foul play in the deaths as the body of the nanny, identified as Anne Wangari, had injuries suspected to have been inflicted by a blunt object. The body of Alice Njeri, the owner of the house, had stab wounds on the chest while her son was strangled using a scarf. Wangari, according to her husband Simon Kimani, was employed by Njeri as a house help only 10 days ago. Also Read: Kimani said Wangari left home on Wednesday at 7am and was expected back by 6pm but she never showed, only for him to later learn of the unfortunate incident. Nakuru Deputy County Police Commander Joseph Tanui said investigations have already been launched into the deaths. The motive of the heinous act however still remains unclear with sources revealing that, before the incident, an unidentified woman reportedly inquired about the Njeri’s specific house. Njeri, a high school teacher, is said to have relocated to the rental houses in a rush barely two weeks ago having recently been deployed to a nearby institution where she reported on May 19, 2021.
