Since President Uhuru Kenyatta eased restrictions on sporting activities on May 1, teams and federations alike have been enthusiastic to return to training ahead of local leagues resumption. However, things have been a little mum on the rugby side as the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) has not issued any direction with regards to the resumption of the national rugby league, the Kenya cup. This has hampered team’s training, as elucidated by the assistant coach of the newly promoted Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology, MMUST RFC John Asila. Asila noted lack of communication from the federation has left clubs in the dark as to when the national circuit will return. “We have not resumed group training as we are waiting for the government program that will enable us to get back to camp. The government gave a go ahead to the resumption of sports but we don’t have the exact date and how this is going to happen. “However, our players are training individually. We have given them the program and are monitoring them online. They send videos of what they do we so that we guide them further as wait for official communication from the Ministry of Sports and the Kenya Rugby Union,” Asila explained. Also Read: Asila is relying heavily on his player’s discipline to carry out their training regimes diligently as he acknowledges the tough task ahead. “Our players understand that the level they are playing in now requires more effort compared to the previous competitions, so we are hopeful that discipline will be their drive to pull up their socks as there will be limited time to train when the league resumes. We have told them all this, and being a university students we expect nothing short of maximum cooperation.” MMUST RFC got promoted to the top tier this season after edging Mean Machine in the playoffs.
