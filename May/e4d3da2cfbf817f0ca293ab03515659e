The TSC is impressed with the high rate of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among teachers. Majority of the teachers aged 58 and above have taken the jab,” she said. Mrs. Macharia said this was achieved despite the fact that most teachers have been on the move, either during the administration of the examination or during the marking exercise. “Having concluded the examination period, I beseech all teachers to take up the jab. The President granted all teachers an opportunity to get the vaccination regardless of age. Let us utilize this gracious opportunity to protect our lives. It is sad to note that so far, we have lost 37 secondary school teachers; including 24 principals, three deputy principals and 10 classroom teachers,” she said.
