A couple from Kholongokhongo village in Budalang’i, Busia County, is appealing for help from medical experts on how to raise their baby boy who was born without both arms. Speaking to Citizen Digital, John Obwaba said the society had sidelined and subjected them to stigma after his wife Rophina Akinyi gave birth to the disabled baby, whom they named Gift Reagan. “Watu wamenitenga kabisa kulingana na maumbile ya huyu mtoto…ni Mungu ambaye alinipatia huyu mtoto na nafurahia, lakini watu wamenitenga…mpaka sai napata fikira mingi kuhusu huyu mtoto, kwa maana sijapata mtu wa kunitembelea na kunikaza roho au kunipea advice vile ntalea huyu mtoto,” he said. Mr. Obwaba expressed fears that the child would never be able to live a normal life or even go to school when he grows up as he could be the subject of ridicule among his peers. “Sijui mtoto wangu atakuwa anaandikia nini (shuleni), na atakuwa anatembeaje, kwa maana hana mikono…kwanza huku kwetu kuna mbu sijui atakuwa anajisaidia namna gani,” said the 35-year-old. His wife, Rophina, on her part, said she first started suspecting that something was wrong with her baby when she was pregnant but, upon visiting a facility, was told the ultrasound scan did not detect any baby in her stomach.

Mr. Obwaba added: “Naomba madaktari na wataalam wanitembelee wanishauri vile naweza lea huyu mtoto na waniambie vile wanaweza nisaidia.” Video Of The Day: | SUCCESS AND AFTER | Tracking the progress made by students who topped KCSE in past years
