The NBA has relaxed the mask requirements for head coaches as the playoffs tip off on Saturday, according to the Associated Press. The league reportedly sent a memo Saturday morning that clears the way for fully vaccinated head coaches to ditch their masks during games. Head coaches still will be required to wear masks for pregame, warm-ups, halftime and postgame. Assistants and players on the bench still will have to adhere to the existing masking protocols. The league also encouraged coaches to wear masks should they meet on court after a game. The NBA’s testing protocols remain in effect for coaches, despite the update. The move comes as teams around the league increase capacity for fans during the playoffs.
