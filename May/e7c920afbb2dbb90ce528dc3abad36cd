The Moses Kuria-led People’s Empowerment Party (PEP) has opted not to field a candidate in the Kiambaa by-election despite recent historic wins in Juja and Gaturi wards. Kuria, who also doubles up as the Gatundu South MP, said the decision was arrived at for the unity of the Hustler Nation following discussions with Deputy President William Ruto. According to the legislator, PEP was set to participate in the July 15 polls but that did not go down well with his fellow Hustler Nation MPs Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira) and Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu) hence has been forced to withdraw. Kuria’s PEP will now most likely support the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party candidate in the by-election, who has since been unveiled as John Njuguna Wanjiku. “PEP’s message of hope and renewal has been endorsed by the voters of Gaturi Ward in Murang’a on 15th December, 2020 and Juja constituency on 18th May 2021. We wanted to present this message for approval by the people of Kiambaa Constituency on the 15th July,” said Kuria in a statement to newsrooms. “However, this did not go down very well with my colleagues particularly Rigathi Gachagua and Kimani Ichung’wah. Yesterday I held extensive discussions with my boss and friend H.E Dr William Ruth on this matter. To make my two colleagues happy and above all for the unity of the Hustler Nation, PEP will NOT be fielding a candidate for the Kiambaa by election.” Also Read: He added: “I take this opportunity to offer my profuse apologies to Raymond Kuria, the people of Kiambaa and all PEP members who undoubtedly will be disappointed with this decision. The good news is we will now focus on a nationwide tour to meet candidates who will be vying for various seats in next year’s General Elections on PEP ticket.” Video Of The Day: | SUCCESS AND AFTER | Tracking the progress made by students who topped KCSE in past years
