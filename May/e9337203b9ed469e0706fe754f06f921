Rafael Nadal won his 10th Italian Open with a 7-5 1-6 6-3 victory over world number one Novak Djokovic in Rome. Both players dropped serve early on in the first set before Nadal took it after securing the key break at 5-5. Djokovic dominated the second set but paid for not taking two break points in the fifth game of the decider. A stunning backhand from Spaniard Nadal saw him break the Serb in the next game before he went on to hold his serve and nerve to close out the match. “I had a very positive week and I’m very happy,” said 34-year-old Nadal, who will defend his French Open title when the tournament at Roland Garros starts on 30 May. The match was their 57th meeting and Djokovic, 33, has had his lead in their head-to-head wins tally cut to 29-28.
