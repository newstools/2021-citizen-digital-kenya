The immediate former Kakamega Homeboyz assistant coach Patrick Odhiambo has replaced his fellow Kenyan Francis Baraza as the head coach of Tanzania mainland premier league side Biashara United. Biashara who are currently fourth on the log have been without a coach since the departure of Baraza. The club’s chairman Selemani Mataso said that among the 60 coaches who applied for the vacant post, they were impressed by Odhiambo. Until his appointment, Odhiambo was serving under Nicholas Muyoti at Football Kenya Federation Premier League side Kakamega Homeboyz, after leaving Gor Mahia in the same capacity. He had earlier coached Sony Sugar in the Kenyan premier league. Former Bandari tactician Bernard Mwalala had also been linked with the club. Also Read: Video Of The Day: Guns galore
