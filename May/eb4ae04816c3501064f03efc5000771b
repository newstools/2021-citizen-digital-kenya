Members of Parliament Moses Kuria, Ndindi Nyoro and Mohammed Ali have been summoned to appear before the House on Thursday, May 13. The three were summoned, according to Speaker Justin Muturi, for dishonouring the house by claiming that members of the Assembly were bribed to vote for the Building Bridges Initiatives (BBI) Bill. The directive was issued on Tuesday afternoon, during a session in which National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi asked that the Gatundu south legislator be suspended. While addressing the sitting, Mbadi said Kuria had exhibited immaturity and had acted in a disorderly manner. On Thursday, the National Assembly passed the BBI Bill, with 224 MPs voting in favor, 63 against, and two abstentions. The vote was mostly partisan, with supporters of BBI co-principals President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga voting in favour of the bill.

The other House of Parliament, the Senate gave the Bill a raucous Yes on Tuesday, with 51 senators for it, while 12 senators voted against it. Senator Isaac Mwaura, who had been officially kicked out of his seat by the Jubilee Party for indiscipline, did not participate in the exercise.
