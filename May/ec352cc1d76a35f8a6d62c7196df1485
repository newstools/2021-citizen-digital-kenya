Deontay Wilder III will take place on July 24 in Las Vegas, promoter Bob Arum said Thursday. Both fighters have verbally agreed on the fight, and Arum said he expects contracts to be signed this week. The purse will favor Fury 60-40, ESPN reported. The fight comes about after an arbitrator ruled that Fury must fight Wilder in a trilogy bout no later than Sept. 15. An alternate date is Aug. 14. Fury had just announced a four-belt unification bout vs. Anthony Joshua in Saudi Arabia when the arbitrator made his ruling. The two sides went to arbitration to settle a disagreement over a rematch clause in their contract after Fury and Wilder fought in 2018 and 2020. The arbitrator ruled that Wilder was owed a third fight with Fury. Wilder was once a perfect 40-0 before fighting to a draw with Fury in December 2018 and then coming away with the first loss of his career in their February 2020 rematch.
