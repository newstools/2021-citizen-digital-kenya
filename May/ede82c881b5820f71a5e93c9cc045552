Former Icaciri Girls Secondary School Principal Jane Muthoni will next month know her fate after she was found guilty of committing the brutal murder of her husband Solomon Mwangi in 2016. The prosecution side on Tuesday presented their submissions before high court judge Joel Ngugi seeking to have Jane Muthoni and her co-accused Issac Njoroge face maximum sentences over the murder. In mitigation, Muthoni urged the courts to be lenient on grounds that the family had gone through a traumatic experience. Solomon Mwangi, a former Principal of Kiru Boys High school, was found murdered at a coffee estate in Karakuta, Muranga county on November 11, 2016, five days after he was reported missing. The sentencing has been slated for June 3, 2021.
