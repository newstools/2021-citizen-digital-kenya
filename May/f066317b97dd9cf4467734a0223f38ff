Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) fought back from a goal down to go second on the FKF-Premier League log after goals on either side of the break from Vincent Wasambo and Derrick Otanga helped them to a 2-1 win over relegation-threatened Mathare United at the Ruaraka Stadium. Mathare head coach Frank Ouna who took over the reins from Salim Ali yesterday had earlier said he could use today’s game to gauge the attitude of his players and his tactics seemed to work with the home side racing to a first minute lead when Daniel Otieno made the most of the poor defending from the Bankers’ rearguard slot home the opener. However, that seemed to the only major highlight of Ouna’s new side at the visitors dominated the ensuing events, restoring parity with a minute before the break via Vincent Wasambo’s deflected effort from the edge of the area before super-substitute Derrick Atambo scored a deserved winner with a quarter of an hour to go. The Slum Boys perhaps could rue John Mwangi’s missed chance in the 72nd minute when he fired wide from close range. With the latest victory, KCB have moved to within three points behind leaders Tusker FC who have 37 points after 16 rounds of play. It will also convince them can rediscover their scintillating form at the start of the season and also challenge for the title, a feat that will help them taste continental football for the first time in their history.
