National Super League (NSL) leaders Football Club Talanta are aiming to stretch their lead on top of the table when they take on third-placed Vihiga Bullets at the Ruaraka Stadium on Saturday. Elsewhere giants Shabana head coach Robert Ojienda expects his charges to stage a better show this afternoon when they host fourth-placed Kibera Black Stars at the Migori Stadium following their 2-2 draw last weekend against Mully Children’s Family. A lapse in concentration in the dying moments of the game allowed MCF talisman Evan Anguyo to score the leveler while underlining another missed victory for the glamour boys. Ojienda says they worked on their focus more so in the last quarter and he expects nothing short of victory against Kibera Black Stars. “I have been with the boys for more than a week now and I can say I understand them better compared to last week. “Our poor marking in the last quarter denied us victory. We have worked on it and I am hoping we will not switch off again going forward.
