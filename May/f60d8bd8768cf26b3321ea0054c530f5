Twenty five people were on Monday arrested in Mlango Kubwa area of Mathare as clashes between two communities ran into the second day. Police had a hard time restoring some semblance of peace with the warring sides keen on locking horns. Several people were injured during the skirmishes. Chaotic scenes rocked Mlango Kubwa area as teargas canisters, blocked roads and burnt tyres were the order of the day. Police officers who were deployed in their numbers engaged groups of youth in running battles as they sought to restore calm. Two conflicting communities for a long time have engaged in a cold war with tension rising each day. The fight for control of business spaces including sale of illicit brews between Ugandans living here and a section of Kenyans is said to be the bone of contention.

Residents kept indoors, only peeping from their balconies for fear of attacks as police conducted door-to-door operations. Police held a regional security meeting to deliberate on how to engage the leadership of the fighting communities to restore peace.
