Kenya’s Titus Ekiru clocked a new personal best of 2:02:57 to defend his title at the Milano Marathon held on Sunday in Italy. The new mark obliterated the previous course record of 2:04:46 which Ekiru himself set in 2019, and was also the fastest time in a marathon on Italian soil. Reuben Kiprop was second in 2:03:55 while Barnabas Kiptum placed third in 2:04:17 as Kenyans swept the podium in the Italian capital. “At the 30km mark I felt I could make a move and together with my friend (Reuben) Kiprop we surged forward. It is a great win for me. I am now going to relax and wait for my next race which I now aim to run 2:01,” said Ekiru. Ethiopia’s Hiwot Gebrekidah won the women’s race in 2:19:35 as Rachael Jemutai of Kenya placed second in 2:22:50 while Eunice Chebichii of Bahrain was third in 2:23:10 Also Read: Video Of The Day: Different journeys, same destiny: The story of top two candidates | KCSE 2020 |
