Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangí has committed to spearhead the construction of a sporting complex in Ruiru to boost sports infrastructure in the Prisons department. The CS announced the plans Wednesday at Magereza House where he received Kenya Prisons volleyball and athletics teams which represented the country in the just concluded women’s African Club and World Relay championships in Tunisia and Poland respectively. Matiangí said the construction of the project, which will include an indoor arena, will start early next year adding that the sports complex ‘aligns with his agenda of promoting sporting activities in the correctional facilities’. “We will begin with the first aspect of the complex so that we can give our men and women the indoor facilities they need. I will be your champion and I’m going to lead a fundraising program with my colleagues on a campaign to sign partnerships with private players to help actualize this project,” said Matiangí. On his part, Prisons coach David Lungáho said the facility will be a vital tool to help bridge the gap between them and North African opponents who have invested heavily in indoor facilities. “Finally we see a ray of hope to our teams because lack of proper training facilities has been the biggest challenge to us. We train outdoor all the time owing to the limit of facilities and when we go out for our competitions we play indoors and it makes no sense to compete with opponents who are fully equipped with better facilities. They will always win against us,” he said. Also Read: Kenya Prisons claimed bronze in Tunisia at the women’s African Club Championships after defeating Nigeria Customs Services in straight sets.
