 Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has called a crisis meeting to deliberate on ways to contain the spread of COVID-19 ahead of the Christmas celebrations. The meeting is slated for Tuesday among members of the National Emergency Response Committee (NERC). Speaking to Business Daily on Monday, Kagwe, however, refused to divulge whether the meeting means Kenyans could be facing new restriction measures soon. “I can’t tell before the NERC meeting. There will be a press conference on Tuesday,” said Kagwe. The National Emergency Response Committee was established in February 2020 to guide the government’s COVID-19 response and it is chaired by CS Kagwe. The meeting comes two days after Health Principal Secretary Susan Mochache stated that there are no plans at the moment to ban people travelling from countries hit by the new Omicron COVID-19 variant from entering into the country. Mochache said the government has intensified surveillance at the entry points to the country and all persons will be screened and show proof that they have been vaccinated. She further urged Kenyans to continue observing the MoH guidelines on combating the spread of the disease, so that the country can remain open to allow economic recovery, especially in this festive season when the tourism industry is expected to pick up. “We cannot continue with an economic depression because of COVID-19. Families must continue to interact and people must continue to move,” the PS said on Sunday.
