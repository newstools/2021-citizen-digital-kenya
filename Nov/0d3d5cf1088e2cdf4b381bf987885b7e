 Taimur Kariuki
Hussein, the Watamu resident who went missing in June this year, has returned
home safely, his kin has reported. The 39-year-old was reported missing on June 28, 2021 after being released by Kahawa
Law Courts. He had initially been arrested by the Anti Terrorism Police Unit
(ATPU) on June 11, in Lamu, for allegedly resisting arrest. The ATPU also
brought up charges of terrorism against him. “TAIMUR IS BACK! At around 6 am.
this morning, my brother called my mum and told her he was on his way back to
Watamu. My brother is home. Traumatized But my brother is safe. He is resting.
Now we debrief. Thank you to everyone who's been through this with us. God is
so so good!” his sister Fauziya said on Twitter. Hussein, his family
say, was barred from calling any of his kin until June 14, 2021 when he was
first presented in court. He is said to have been nursing injuries after ATPU
detectives allegedly assaulted him. On June 18, the court
ordered Hussein to be transferred to Nairobi’s ATPU division for further
investigation. He was not seen again until he was presented before court on
Monday 21st June.  His charges were dropped a week later with police being ordered to facilitate his release. When his charges were
dropped, Hussein was instructed to report back to the ATPU for a final exit
statement before his release. His lawyer informed him that his mother and
sister would meet him at the ATPU offices but when they arrived, the sleuths
claimed that Hussein had been released 30 minutes earlier.  His kin, however,
never got to see or talk to him after the purported release.
