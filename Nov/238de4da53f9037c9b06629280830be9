Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) have launched a search for a man charged with a 20 million shillings fraud. Detectives said, Sammy Gichuki Waigwa is wanted for absconding court, over the fraud-related charges. The practising lawyer under S. Gichuki Waigwa & Associates was charged in 2017 with stealing from Aguthi Enterprises. He appeared in court for the first hearing, never to be seen again. A warrant of arrest has since been issued against him. Members of the public have been urged to volunteer information that could lead to his arrest by contacting the DCI.
