After public complaints, the government through the Kenya Urban Roads Agency (KURA) has moved to fix a section of Ngong Road that has caused many vehicle accidents. This comes a day after the emergence of a spat between KURA and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) over who is responsible for safety and lighting of the road. Motorists who ply the Ngong Road route this week protested over the stretch from Dagoretti Bridge up to Lenana area, saying it lacked road signage that indicate the two U-turns that have put their lives at risk. They also wanted proper lighting erected along the area to reduce the number of accidents that have been witnessed in the recent past. Driving along the road, there are two U-turns, one for motorists coming from City Center and another for those coming from Ngong into the City. On the opposite side of the road heading into the City from Ngong, there are no road marks. The dotted lane from City Center leading to the U-turn is short and becomes problematic for speeding drivers. "The road has no signage and as you slow down to make a U-turn, you are hit from behind. It is worse at night when an oncoming driver on the other side of the road puts on full light because vision is blurred," said Michael Shikanda, a motorist. "This area should have been expanded a bit because there is plenty of empty space left between the road yet the lanes are so squeezed," added Hellen Okapesi, a resident of the Race Course area. KURA chief corporate communications officer John Cheboi said the section of the road is being repaired to ensure safety for motorists. "We are improving the area by removing what was like an island and which gave motorists problems because they would think the road is continuous," said Cheboi. "Signage will be part of the improvement not only at the area but along the entire road," he added.
