Two people were killed in two separate accidents on the Makutano-Sagana and Kagio-Kutus roads in Kirinyaga County. The first accident occurred on Saturday evening at Tana Garden along Makutano -Sagana road where a middle-aged man lost his life after being run over by a 14-seater matatu from Nairobi. According to Mutithi ward MCA Peter Njomo who witnessed the accident, the man was crossing the road heading home at around 9 pm. Njomo said the man died on the spot further stating that no passenger has suffered any injuries. He said that in the last two weeks 6 people have lost their lives along the Makutano-Sagana highway, further advising motorists to be vigilant and cautious whenever plying the route. "I would love to urge the drivers who use this route to be very careful as the road is currently under construction. They ferry human beings and should not put them at any risk," Njomo said. The second accident occurred on Sunday morning at Kimicha trading center along Kagio-Kutus road after a speeding bread delivery truck from Nyeri headed to Nairobi lost control and slammed into a Motorcycle operator who distributes Cigarettes. The biker died on the spot. Angry Kimicha residents wanted to lynch the truck driver who sped off to a local police station. The residents have further lamented over the sluggish response from security officers and called upon the county government to facilitate funds on improving the appalling state in the area. "We wonder why police officers from Kerugoya traffic department took over three hours to come to pick the body. Only one car is operational in the whole region.  two bodies have been taken to Kerugoya Mortuary," said Mirigu a resident in the area. The two bodies were later ferried to Kerugoya hospital mortuary by Sagana police station officers
