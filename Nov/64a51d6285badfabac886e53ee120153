 The Ministry of Health has directed owners of public facilities to require proof of full COVID-19 vaccination from patrons starting December 21. Speaking Sunday, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said the directive applies to national parks and game reserves, hotels bars and restaurants, businesses serving more than 50 people a day, and all indoor gatherings. “... All businesses, including small and medium enterprises, serving 50 or more people a day to put up signage requiring proof of vaccination before entry into their premises and their patrons to be fully vaccinated,” stated Kagwe. The CS further directed that all indoor gatherings be limited to two thirds capacity, with proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all in attendance. “We are appealing to the Interfaith Council to review and adapt these new measures as appropriate,” he added. Kagwe added that violators of the directive will be slapped with hefty fines. “If you are a bar owner don't wait until you are slapped with a heavy fine, ensure all coming in have proof of vaccination,” he said. On his part, Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala welcomed the directive, saying it was part of a larger set of measures the international community is taking. “We want to be compliant with the international community so that we have a safe population. When you are fully vaccinated you are much safer,” he stated. Balala further divulged that the government was also considering enforcing proof of COVID-19 test results for domestic travels. “At a later stage we will review the issue of requirement of PCR testing, especially for travellers. For now we want to welcome the pronouncement of requiring all the facilities to demand vaccination certificates,” said Balala, adding: “If you fail, there will be a penalty on both the facilities and the individuals.” According to data released by the Ministry of Health on Sunday, over 95% of all those hospitalized with COVID-19 complications are unvaccinated.
