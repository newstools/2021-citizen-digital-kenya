 Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has hit
back at the County's Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici over her sentiments that
she is retreating to pave way for Waiguru to shine in the UDA party. Speaking on Thursday, Waiguru bashed
Ngirici saying that the United Democratic Party is for everyone regardless of whether
you were first or last to join. “Hakuna chama ya mtu binafsi, chama ni ya wananchi.
Na UDA ni ya kila mtu na wananchi ndio walisema tuingie,” Waiguru stated. “Kwa sababu mtu amekuja mbele, haimaanishi
hakuna mtu mwingine atakuja. Kwa sababu mtu alianzisha mtu mmoja, atakaa mtu
mmoja? Si lazma watu waongezeke wakue wengi?” Waiguru posed.  The 2022 gubernatorial hopeful further told off
her competitor saying that "she had listened to the voice of her electorates" in
joining the party and should not be sidelined for her decision. “Wananchi ndio waliniambia niingie, na
mimi nikakuwa mtu anaskiza ground na nikaingia UDA. Mimi kura yangu ni moja, wananchi
ndio wataamua katika mashindano,” she said. Waiguru further urged Ngirici to be
welcoming to competition saying that it is the vote and choice of the electorates that will determine their next leader. “Asiyekubali kushindwa si mshindani; bado tunatafta
watu wengine, wale ambao hawajajiandikisha katika chama cha UDA, tunataka watu wote
waingie UDA ili tushindane," she said. Ngirici had earlier on Thursday taken a
swipe at the governor claiming she was fond of copying her political moves and
thus she would be taking time off UDA to self-reflect and strategize on her
next move. “Politics is like a chess game, you must
study it well. I have retreated to study it carefully before making my next
move,” Ngirici told The Standard on Wednesday.  She added: “I'm also giving space for
newcomers to enjoy UDA. That's why you won't see me in Ruto’s meetings.”
