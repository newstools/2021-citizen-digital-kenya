Kenyan lawyer Miguna Miguna has been directed to obtain his emergency travel documents from wherever he is, in order for him to be allowed into the country. In a ruling delivered on Monday, Justice Hedwig Ongudi said that with the relevant documents, Miguna will be allowed to  board the next available flight to Kenya. During the same ruling, the court said that Miguna cannot be allowed to use the Kenyan Identity card as a travel document as it is not permitted "It is only upon entering Kenya that he will use his  ID for identification since he does not have a valid Kenyan passport," Justice Ongudi said. "The orders issues by Justice Korir  on the use of the ID card were only for purposes of identification only , and not travels  since the applicant does not have a valid Kenyan passport," According to the court, the requirement of a passport is uniform to all Kenyans and is needed at all airports across the globe. Miguna will be required to obtain the relevant documents from the Kenyan Embassies in Berlin or in Ottawa within the next 72 hours in order to facilitate his travel back to Kenya. "The petitioner is hereby ordered to obtain the relevant travel documents from the Kenya High Commision in Ottawa or Berlin or wherever he is within the next 72 hours," Justice Ongudi ordered. Justice Ongudi further directed Miguna to apply for his passport upon landing in the country, and directed the relevant agencies to issue the passport within seven days. Shortly after the new orders were issued, Miguna took to Twitter to thank his lawyers, saying he would present himself to the Kenyan embassy within 2 hours. "I'm not visiting the Kenyan Embassy to apply for citizenship which I never lost. The Court has once more AFFIRMED that I am a Kenyan by birth who must enter Kenya as a Kenyan upon presentation of my National ID card," Miguna Tweeted  "The Embassy has been ordered to issue a travel document,"
