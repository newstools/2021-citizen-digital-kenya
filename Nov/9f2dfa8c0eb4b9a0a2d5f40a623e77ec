 The Kenyan government has received 907, 200 doses of Johnson and
Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to boost the country’s vaccination campaign. The Ministry of Health said on Wednesday the
vaccines were donated by the Mastercard Foundation through the AVAT mechanism of
the African Union. MoH also confirmed receiving 7.5 million syringes of Pfizer
vaccines in preparation for the 4 million vaccines expected to jet in the country soon. So far, the country has about 10.7 million vaccines and is
looking forward to more vaccines before the end of the year. “Between now and the end of December the government expects 8
million more vaccines on top of the 10.7 million already received,” MoH
stated. The ministry further noted that it seeks to buy more doses
of Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccines through the AVAT mechanism. “The government is also procuring 13 million doses of
Johnson and Johnson through the AVAT mechanism and in early December we expect
another 1.6 milion of Johnson and Johnson," MoH noted. This comes as a vaccination drive aimed to meet President
Uhuru Kenyatta’s target of administering 10 million vaccines by the end of
December 2021 is underway. The Ministry still believes that the target is still on
course and is imploring citizens to turn out for vaccination and advocating for mobilization
of people by the county governments. “We are urging the county governments to mobilize their
people for this vaccination campaign. There are enough vaccines in the country
and therefore we appeal to all eligible Kenyans to turn out at our approved
sites and get vaccinated,” read the MoH statement. A report from the Ministry of Health indicates that a total of 6,494,091 vaccines had been
administered across the country as of November 23, 2021.  Of these, 4,033,811 were partially vaccinated while those fully vaccinated were 2,460,280.
