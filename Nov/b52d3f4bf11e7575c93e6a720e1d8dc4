 By Mainda Facii Residents of Muriri Muthara in Tigania East
sub-county have called on Deputy President William Ruto to come clean on a Ksh.600,000 handout he allegedly left them during his tour of Meru County on
Tuesday. The residents on Friday barricaded the
Meru-Maua road demanding the cash left behind for boda boda operators
and  women groups to share equally amongst themselves. It is alleged that the DP gave the handout
after Titus Mwiti, an aspirant for the Tigania East MP seat, asked the UDA
leader to help the two factions better their businesses. Despite area MP Gichunge Kabeabea being away
during Ruto’s visit, residents had initially claimed he is holding the funds, a
statement he has since rebuffed. The locals now suspect the DP could have left
'air' behind when he pledged to give the handout.  Police were forced to fire in the air and
throw tear gas to disperse the angry crowd who were burning tires on the busy
road and disrupting oncoming traffic.
