 A fourth petition has been filed seeking the
removal of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji from office. The petitioner, Charles Rubia, claims that
the Office of the DPP is tainted with corrupt and malicious practices, favouritism and gross
misconduct, as well as high degrees of incompetence. “It is evident lately, that shortlisting of
candidates has been based on tribalism, nepotism and clannism instead of
qualification,” said Rubia. According to the petitioner, the recruitment
process of staff in the office has become shambolic and full of corruption. Rubia claims that there have been unfair
promotions and deployment of prosecutors in the office of the DPP, adding that
in the last four years after his appointment the office has been tainted with
favouritism, nepotism, tribalism, clannism, misuse and abuse of office, gross
misconduct and high degree of incompetence. Through lawyer Danstan Omari, Rubia claims
that the transfers of State lawyers have led to dragging of cases and
disrupting court proceedings, adding that junior prosecution counsel have
unprocedurally risen through the ranks. “There has been no explanation as to why the
DPP has discontinued the services of well-seasoned Senior Prosecution Counsels
and replaced them with junior counsels who are yet to gain the requisite experience,”
read court papers.  Rubia further claims that the ODPP HR Manual
has been violated severally, arguing that recruitment process of staff has
become a shambolic exercise full of corruption, nepotism, tribalism, clannism and
favouritism, accusing Haji of having the last say on who should get the job or
not.
