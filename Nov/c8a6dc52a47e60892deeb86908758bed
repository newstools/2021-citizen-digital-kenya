 Meru
Governor Kiraitu Murungi on Saturday officially launched the Devolution
Empowerment Party (DEP) at the Bomas of Kenya, as he ramps up mobilization efforts
ahead of next year’s polls. According
to the Governor, who was the keynote speaker at the launch event, the new party
will reshape Kenya’s history and give Meru and the larger Mount Kenya region more
bargaining power in all matters local politics. “This
is one of the happiest days of my life. I feel greatly honoured to be the
keynote speaker on this historic game changing occasion. This event marks a significant
turning point in the history and politics of this country,” he said. Murungi
continued on to say that during his long political career, he has been a victim
of political mirages and empty promises from politicians but he has learnt his
lesson which has culminated in the formation of DEP. “I
have been actively involved in the formation, management and campaigns of most
of the political parties in this country and in the process I have learnt many
lessons I want to bring those lessons to our new party,” he said. “They
say don’t get mad, don’t get angry, don’t try to get even, get ahead. Use the
energy to get ahead so we are here today to get ahead.” The DEP party symbol is
that of a bus, a callback to the Governor’s Alliance Party of Kenya that folded
to join the Jubilee party. “In
the past I was known as the bus driver but I lost my job. Today I am happy that
the bus is back so I am going to get my job back. I am happy because the bus is
my home,” the Mery Governor said.  “Come
August 2022, I intend to win the seat of the governor of Meru on a bus ticket.”
