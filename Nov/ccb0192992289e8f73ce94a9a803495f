 A
police officer and two civilians have been identified as the three people killed
in the twin explosions in Kampala, Uganda, on Tuesday. Uganda
police said in a statement that 27 police officers were among the injured and
that 19 had already left hospital. The
so-called Islamic State group (IS) has said through its telegram channel that
it was behind the blasts. President
Yoweri Museveni, in a series of tweets on Tuesday night, condemned the attacks
saying they were being carried out by “confused grandchildren.” “Today
at 10:00hours, some pigs (in reality manipulated and confused Bazzukulu),
apparently, blew themselves up, near the IGG office and the other near CPS. At
about 10:30hours, the CMI/Police squads injured and captured the third
terrorist in the area of Katooke, Bwaise with his bomb. He, later, died but
gave us very good information before dying,” wrote Museveni.  "They have exposed themselves when we are more ready for
urban terrorism. They will perish,” he added.
