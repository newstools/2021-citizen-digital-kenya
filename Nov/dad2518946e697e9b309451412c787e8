The Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) on Friday nabbed a suspected fraudster posing as a recruitment officer to extract Ksh. 400,000 from a woman in Eldoret. According to the Ministry of Defence, the suspect, Isaac Serem, was disguised as a KDF personnel and was in possession of a fake KDF calling letter. He then requested for the said amount to admit the woman’s daughter in the just concluded KDF countrywide recruitment exercise. He was apprehended and is currently in police custody awaiting arraignment. The Ministry has cautioned Kenyans over falling prey to fraudsters promising jobs noting that the recruitment exercise is already complete. “KDF reminds all Kenyans that the recruitment exercise has been concluded and any person purporting to assist anyone to secure a slot into the military is a con and should be reported to the nearest police station or through the KDF hotlines: 0726419709/0120300599,” read the statement.
