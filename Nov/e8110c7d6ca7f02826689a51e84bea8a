 The High Court has directed the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) to find the whereabouts of missing Ethiopian businessman Samson Gebreigzi Teklemichael, reportedly abducted by security agencies last week in Nairobi.  The ODPP will be required to appear in court on Monday, November 29, with answers.  The latest comes just a day after a Nairobi based lawyer filed an application at the High Court on behalf of Ethiopian businessman, asking the court to direct the Inspector General of Police to produce the Ethiopian national.  The Ethiopian was kidnapped in broad daylight on Sunday the 21st by people suspected to be Kenyan security officers.  In the application certified as urgent, lawyer Stanley Kang'ahi asked the court not to allow the businessman's removal out of its jurisdiction as he could be deported out of the country.  The lawyer is also asking the court to order businessman Teklemichael's release.  Teklemichael's wife, Milen halefoam Mezgebo, in an affidavit to support the application, said she was fearful and apprehensive that her husband could be in danger, saying all efforts to inquire about his whereabouts from the police had borne no fruit.
