 Deputy
President William Ruto on Tuesday received Laikipia Woman Representative Cate
Waruguru back into his UDA party at his official residence in Karen. Waruguru
ditched Ruto’s Camp in July 2020, after falling out with the DP over claims
that he had failed to keep his promises and she instead opted to side with President Uhuru
Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. "Welcome
back home," Ruto said on his official Twitter page as he posed for
pictures with Waruguru’s delegation and other officials who were all smiles for
the photo op. On
her part, Waruguru stated that she now realizes that DP Ruto is the man to beat
in next year’s elections after taking time to think about her next political
move. “Purpose
leads a true leader and a true leader leads others @William Ruto. Mpango ni
BOTTOM UP, Form ni Hustler Nation, Chama ni UDA,” Waruguru tweeted. Waruguru’s
decision to re-join UDA, comes after a meeting with two close staunch
supporters of DP Ruto; Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika, and Malindi MP Aisha Juma,
last week. In July 2021, the
Laikipia Woman Rep alluded to reuniting with the DP’s camp saying she had listened to
the people she represents and identified Ruto as the top contender to succeed
President Kenyatta. In October last month, Kirinyaga
Governor Anne Waiguru also joined DP Ruto’s UDA party with her eyes set on
defending her gubernatorial seat come next year’s elections.  On Thursday, Law Society
of Kenya (LSK) President Nelson Havi joined the DP’s camp after Havi having recently announced
his interest to run for the Westlands parliamentary seat in next year’s General
Elections.
