Gor Mahia tactician Mark Harrison is now calling upon cooperates and other profit-making institutions to start sponsoring grassroots clubs since it is the only way raw talents could be nurtured to enable football flourish. His sentiments come barely two months after top-tier league sponsors as well as those of the lower tiwr football leagues pulled the plug on their sponsorship. And the Briton is not amused by the developments  saying grassroots clubs need to be supported in terms of finance and facilities because ‘these clubs are the epicentre of raw talents in the country’. “We need more sponsors around the country, grassroots football clubs need it, if an African nation wants to think about winning the World Cup it should start here from the academy level because there is no real education for the youngsters,” he said. The Briton was speaking in Murang’a after Gor Mahia beat NSL side Murang’a SEAL 1-0, in a friendly match dubbed ‘Handshake derby’ that was played at St. Sebastien Park in Kiharu, Murang’a. The tactician said he was impressed with how their opponents played against his charges despite K’Ogalo having superior experience over their hosts.

At the same time he accused FKF of rushing the start of the new season only to later suspend it for three weeks to allow for international break. “We started the new season and now we are taking a three weeks break, it does not make sense, you force teams into playing when they are not ready which is detrimental,” he lamented. Gor Mahia’s win over Murang’a County side was their second consecutive victory in a span of two days after beating Mathare United 2-1 on Saturday.
