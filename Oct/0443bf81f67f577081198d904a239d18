Siaya Senator James Orengo now says there should not be any doubt about Mt. Kenya region’s support for ODM leader Raila Odinga’s 2022 presidential bid. Senator Orengo said that the overwhelming support and arousing welcome that Mr. Odinga has been getting in Central Kenya of late is a clear indication that the region has already taken a direction. He dispelled fears that Mr. Odinga could be shortchanged, adding that the cordial working relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta together with the Head of State’s latest remarks is also a proof that indeed he is solidly behind the former premier’s presidential ambition. Senator Orengo, who spoke during an ID card registration drive at Usigu health center in Bondo on Friday, assured ODM supporters that this time round Mr. Odinga’s votes shall not be stolen. “In order to confirm the Mt. Kenya support for Mr. Odinga, we will bring MPs and Senators from Central Kenya to Nyanza to prove to the people that indeed they are behind him,” he stated. He stated that, right now, they want to concentrate on national politics to ensure Mr. Odinga clinches the top seat, adding that there won’t be anything beneficial if the ODM party leader can fail to ascend to the presidency.
