As many as 17 American Christian missionaries and their families, including children, were kidnapped on Saturday by gang members in Haiti’s capital of Port-au-Prince, The New York Times reported, citing security officials there. The kidnapping happened as the missionaries were leaving an orphanage in the crisis-engulfed Caribbean nation, the Times said. They were abducted from a bus headed to the airport to drop off some members of the group before continuing to another destination in Haiti, the report added, citing local officials. Jennifer Viau, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department in Washington, said by email that “we’re looking into this.” The U.S. Embassy in Haiti did not respond to a request for comment outside business hours. A spokesperson for the Haitian police said she was seeking information on the issue. The report did not give details on the missionaries or their church.
