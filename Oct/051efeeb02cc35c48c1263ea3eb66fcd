Kenya’s Angela Tanui has won the 2021 Amsterdam Marathon in a new course record of 2 hours 17 minutes and 57 seconds ahead of compatriot Maureen Chepkemoi who finished second in two hours,20 minutes and 18 seconds. Tanui obliterated the previous course record of two hours, 19 seconds and 26 seconds set by Ethiopia’s Degitu Azimeraw in 2019. Tanui who trains alongside the newly crowned Boston Marathon champion Diana Kipyogei dedicated her hard earned victory to the late Agnes Tirop who was found murdered in her house in Iten. “I am very happy to have won this race today. As you know we are still mourning one of our own Agnes and that really pushed me to win this race,” said Tanui. In the men’s race Ethiopia’s Tamirat Tola brought to an end Kenya’s dominance as he broke the course record winning the race in 2 hours, three minutes and 39 seconds. Kenya’s Bernard Koech (2:04:09), Jonathan Korir (2:04:32), Kenneth Keter (2:06:05) and Bernard Kipyego (2:06:32) placed second, fourth, eighth and ninth respectively.
