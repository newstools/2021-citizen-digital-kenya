Police officers in Kapenguria are holding a 29-year-old murder suspect Nelson Baraza alias “Tupa Tupa” who killed his lover in love-gone-sour before surrendering to the police. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the suspect walked casually into a police station and requested to see the DCIO over a matter he wanted to report. “He was led to the criminal investigations office where he told our officers that he had murdered his girlfriend and didn’t want her kin and our officers to spend valuable time looking for her,” the DCI said in a statement. “He therefore requested the officers to accompany him to the location where he had committed the crime and left the body. The officers who were bemused by the man’s confession questioned him further on the veracity of his claims, since such admissions are hard to come by” The suspect then led detectives to the crime scene, about 10 kilometers from the station, where the body of a woman now identified as Egla Chepkorir, 20, was discovered, ‘sprawled under a tree in the middle of a maize plantation’. He told detectives that he murdered the girl after discovering she was having an affair with another man, and that “the pain of betrayal was too much to bear, so he lured her to the plantation and brutally murdered her with a leso.” Kapenguria-based detectives processed the murder scene, recovered the leso, believed to have been used to strangle the victim and arrested the suspect.
