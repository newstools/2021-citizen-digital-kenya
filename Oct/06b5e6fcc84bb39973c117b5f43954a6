Two male students from Mwache Secondary School in Suna East drowned in river Migori on Sunday. Area Assistant Chief George Owiti said the two students  who are in Form One and Form Four were  from a church event and they  were trying to cross the  river on their way back home when they drowned. He said the deceased were in the company of another young boy who managed to cross the river safely. The area Assistant chief said the boy who survived indicated that he crossed the river ahead of the two and advised the deceased not to cross the river because of the surge in water levels but they ignored. Mr.Owiti said the bodies of the two students are yet to be retrieved from the river. He appealed to the communities living around river Migori to give them a report in case they spot the two bodies.
