Former Chief Justice Dr. Willy Mutunga has blamed politicians for passionately supporting football from foreign leagues while overlooking the Kenyan game. He singled out Deputy President Dr. William Ruto and the ODM party leader Raila Odinga who are self-proclaimed Arsenal fans, adding he would love to see them use their influence to help grow some love for Kenyan clubs. His sentiments come off the back of the national team Harambee Stars’ 6-0 aggregate drubbing by Mali during their two-legged World Cup qualifying matches. The FKF President Nick Mwendwa has been the most hit in the blame game for how he handled the Kenyan national team coaches in the firing and hiring spree with political leaders now being dragged in. “Even now are you surprised that our politicians support premier league teams? Okay the deputy president (Dr. William Samoei arap Ruto) and Raila (Amollo Odinga) are supporting Arsenal. My friend Suleman Shahbaz is also supporting Arsenal,” Mutunga said. Mutunga says the more the foreign leagues are revered, the more the domestic ones will decline. Also Read: In an interview on Citizen Tv on Tuesday night, the former CJ submitted that football is great but insisted we don’t have to support foreign teams that “don’t mean anything to us.” He has added that it is also appalling to realize that many Kenyans do not know the current Harambee Stars captain (Michael Olunga) yet they know much about Premier League clubs. “Soon they are going to divide the youth on the basis of foreign teams that don’t mean anything to us. Football is great, but we don’t have to support foreign teams. Ask a lot of people who is the captain of Harambee Stars, they don’t know!” Mutunga underscored. Locally, Raila is supporting Gor Mahia while ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi is a diehard fan of AFC Leopards while Kalonzo Musyoka supports Sofapaka.
