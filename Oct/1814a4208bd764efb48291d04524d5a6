One person died while several others sustained serious injuries after a wall of a house collapsed on them on Thursday on Parklands Fifth Avenue. Witnesses said the wall of an adjacent building gave in and collapsed, injuring one of the construction workers. His colleagues who were setting the concrete piers of a new building rushed to to save him but sustained serious injuries after another section of the well caved in showering them in debris. The injured were rushed to the St Mary’s hospital. The National Construction Authority closed the construction site on Thursday afternoon, claiming that it was built illegally, without leaving the required two meters between its walls and the adjacent building.
