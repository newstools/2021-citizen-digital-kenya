Navigated by Tim Jessop in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, Tundo racked up the Nanyuki Rally Group (NRG) round despite the 5minutes penalty he incurred for outside assistance. Carl came flat-out into the flying finish but his Evo stalled just as he had pulled into CS6 Greystone 2 TC End. The 5 minutes penalty was applied by the stewards when he was pushed by Jammeet Chana from the back until the car started motoring again through to the last service. Aakif Virani in an ex-Manvir Baryan Skoda Fabia R5 romped home in a career best second. Ugandan Amaanraj Rai, navigated by Kisumu’s Gurdeep Panesar completed the podium dash in a career best KNRC third place. It was a bitter pill to swallow for longtime leader Baldev Chager who also incurred a massive 20 minutes penalty for going off the route course. Chager led the pack after the early morning 77km three stage first loop, but picked up a puncture in the second loop to dip to second behind Tundo before the penalty was added to his cumulative time. Also Read: Chager nevertheless picked 5 bonus points for winning the power stage which was the repeat run of the Greystone stage. Jasmeet Chana suffered turbo gremlins in the last stage to settle for fourth place ahead of FIA Rally Star driver McRae Kimathi. Piero Canobbio from Kilifi settled for sixth.
