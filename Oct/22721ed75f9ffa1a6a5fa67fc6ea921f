Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi is now urging President Uhuru Kenyatta to lift the nationwide curfew imposed over the COVID-19 pandemic. Mudavadi, addressing the media on Thursday, cited the declining COVID-19 positivity rate, saying it is time for the government to set aside the 10pm to 4am nationwide curfew to protect the livelihoods of Kenyans. The ANC leader noted that the curfew is worsening the situation for Kenyans who are already grappling with economic hardships. “I call upon President Uhuru Kenyatta to lift the curfew that is aggravating the economic hardships faced by Kenyans under Covid-19. The prevalence rate has gone down. Kenyans should, however, continue observing Ministry of Health safety protocols,” said Mudavadi. “The economic hardships continue to bite several sectors of our economy; the transport sector, small scale traders sector, hospitality sector and the message that is coming through is that it is time the curfew is lifted.” He was speaking during a meeting of ANC party officials in Nairobi.
