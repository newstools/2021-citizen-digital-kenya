Chief Justice Martha Koome says the Supreme Court is prepared to handle presidential election disputes should any arise after the 2022 election. Koome was speaking on Monday in Karen when she presided over the launch of the Kenya Judiciary Academy campus. “We are prepared to the tooth and nail on how to deal with any dispute that would arise, including the use of technology,” said justice Koome. However, CJ Koome noted that she hopes that the election processes will be peaceful. The ceremony further saw the installation of Supreme Court Judge Smokin Wanjala as the incoming director of the Judiciary Training Institute. On his part, Justice Wanjala said he is optimistic of a peaceful presidential election and smooth power transition come 2022.

Recounting a previous discussion with his colleagues, Justice Wanjala said: “Some of us said there will not only be just one presidential election petition, there will be two. Others said there will be many.” “Speaking for myself, I said, actually, there will be none,” he added. The CJ’s comments come just days after Wanjala expressed the Judiciary Committee on Elections’ expectations that the number of election petitions in 2022 will double those of the past polls. “It is logical, given the nature of election contestation, more Kenyans will definitely go to court. So we are making continuous preparations in advance,” said Wanjala. Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
