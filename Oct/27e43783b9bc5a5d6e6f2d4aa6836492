The National Treasury has finally moved to breathe life back to the Privatization Commission after serving Parliament with a list of nominees to fill gaps in its board. Subsequently, Treasury has forwarded the names of Dr. Edward Kobuthi, Irene Wanyoike, Celine Orata, Salah Abdi, CPA David Nyakang’o and Wellington Godo to the National Assembly. The shortlisted persons if approved by the house, are expected to fill up six vacancies on the board of the Privatization Commission. The board of the Privatization Commission has not been fully constituted for years limiting the scope of the State agency operations. In a 2020 report, the Office of the Auditor General for instance said the commission failed to finalize the implementation of its privatization program running to the end of 2021 from the gaps on its board. At the same time, the exchequer Ministry has nominated four candidates to take up spots in the board of the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) subject to approval by the National Assembly.
