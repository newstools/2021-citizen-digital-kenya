A nanny who attacked her employer’s family and killed their 7-year-old son in Marigat, Baringo County, has been arrested by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). The suspect, Lydiah Jelagat Kipng’etich, reportedly crept into her employer’s master bedroom and attacked her with a panga and a rungu as she slept. According to a statement from the DCI, the man of the house was away on duty at the time of the incident. The woman’s screams for help attracted the attention of neighbours who rushed to the scene to rescue her. Jelagat, 24, however managed to escape in the cover of darkness before the neighbours could arrive at the scene of crime. “It was in the process of getting the woman ready for hospital that the neighbours stumbled upon the boy’s cold body hidden under the bed. He had some blood oozing from the mouth, with no physical injuries,” read the statement.
