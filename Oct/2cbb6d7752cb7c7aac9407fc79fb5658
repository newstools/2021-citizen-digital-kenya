A heavy traffic snarl-up on Nairobi’s Outering Road caused a middle-aged woman to give birth while on her way to hospital Monday morning. According to eye-witnesses the lady’s water broke while en route to hospital but traffic on the busy city road made it impossible for her to get proper medical attention on time and as such she was forced to give birth by the roadside. “I was passing by on my way to work when I noticed some men had gathered around a personal vehicle. I immediately noticed the pregnant woman who was writhing in pain so I stopped to see if I could offer any assistance,” a female eyewitness said. “The baby’s head was already visible but the woman wanted to hold the baby in until she got to the hospital but I advised her against it because she might have ended up hurting the child.  The two men who had accompanied the woman had no experience in delivering children and if I am being honest they looked visibly shocked as such I had to step in and help the mother to be,” she added. After deliberating on whether the woman should give birth inside or outside the vehicle, the good Samaritan successfully helped the woman deliver her child. “The two men who had accompanied the woman wanted to move her outside the car but I advised them to let her deliver in the vehicle away from prying eyes. After a few minutes I successfully helped the woman deliver her child. They still decided to go to hospital afterwards but at least both the mother and child are safe,” the female eyewitness explained. With Mashujaa day just two days away, Kenyans took to Twitter to laud the woman for her kindness and selfless act. “That’s a Shujaa talking right there,” Solo Ngatia tweeted. “I want to see this woman awarded on Mashujaa Day,” Stephen Mulandi wrote.
