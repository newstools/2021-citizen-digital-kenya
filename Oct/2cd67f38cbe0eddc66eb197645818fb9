A petition has been filed before the Public Service Commission (PSC) seeking to have Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji removed from office. The family of the late Tob Cohen, through their lawyers, are accusing DPP Haji of mishandling the murder case of their kin. They are also accusing the DPP of mishandling other cases among them Direct Line Assurance Limited and the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA) case. The petitioner; Cohen’s sister Gabriel Hannan Van Straten, claims that the DPP despite having 19 years of experience in the legal practice, since he took office, he has never set foot in any known courts of law whether in the subordinate courts or the Superior Courts. “The DPP Public Haji lacks all requisite experience as provided for under Article 157 (3) Constitution of Kenya, 2010,” reads the petition. The petitioner further claims that actions of the DPP interfering with Criminal investigations by the DCI is taking centre stage during investigations. Also Read: The family claims that the Director of Public Prosecutions is operating openly with impunity by protecting persons that are perceived as influential or high in social status such as Justice Sankale, a clear indication of abuse of office and misuse of power on his part. “That Noordin Haji the DPP herein, has demonstrated such abuse of power and abuse of office by restraining the Director of Criminal Investigations from arresting the Judge Sankale, for his involvement in the murder and subsequent cover up of the Petitioner’s brother Tob Cohen until and unless the Director of Criminal Investigation gets explicit authorization from him (Director of Public Prosecutions),” reads the petition. They further claim that such a directive from the DPP does not serve the best interest of justice for the victims of the late Tob Cohen.
