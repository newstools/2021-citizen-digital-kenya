The first batch of the Pfizer vaccine syringes are expected in the country on Saturday. The Ministry of Health says, the second shipment will arrive on Sunday with the remainder expected in the country on Monday. This is part of the National accelerated Covid-19 vaccination campaign. The move is set to boost government efforts towards meeting its target of vaccinating 10 million Kenyans by December. The Ministry announced that the administration of the Pfizer vaccine will begin next week. The development follows the expected arrival of 2.2 million specialised syringes. The administration of the one million Pfizer vaccine doses already in the county, which was a donation from the US government, had been delayed due to lack of specialised syringes.
