Three-time Olympic champion Shally- Anne Fraser- Pryce of Jamaica is among foreign athletes who have sent a messages of condolences following the untimely demise of Kenya’s renowned athlete Agnes Tirop. Tirop’s lifeless body with stab wounds on the neck was found at her house in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet County on Wednesday with the husband the prime suspect of the heinous act according to Keiyo North police commandant Tom Makori. At 25, Tirop had already established herself as a household name in distance running where she became one of the youngest athletes to clinch world cross country title in 2015 at 19. Just a month ago, Tirop had smashed the women-only 10km world record when she clocked 30:01 in a race held in Germany, erasing 28 seconds off the previous 19 year old record held by Morocco’s Asmae Leghzaoui. Pryce won a gold medal in the women’s 4x100m relay at the Tokyo Olympics where Tirop placed fourth in the women’s 5000m. “My Kenyan fans, we mourn with you. Condolences to the family and friends of Agnes,” Pryce said on her official twitter account.
