Newly acquired Sofapaka FC striker Robert Karisa Ponda says he is ready to reciprocate his scoring form at his new work station despite the challenges in the top tier. The 20-year-old striker was signed from division one side Ruiru Hotstars where he was the top scorer in the just concluded Zone A league with 23 goals to his name. “I want to continue where I stopped although this is a new league and a tougher one but I will do my best,” Ponda explained. He added, “Being my first time in the premier league, I hope to adapt very fast and start banging goals because that is why I was signed.” Ponda who has already scored two goals in a friendly match against Kibera Blackstars added that his target in the new season will be to don national team colours. “Wearing national team jersey is my bigger dream and I know I will actualise it here at Sofapaka.” Also Read: The youthful striker penned  a three-year deal with the Wundanyi based side.
