The National Assembly Committee on Finance has fined Petroleum Cabinet Secretary John Munyes Ksh.500,000 for failing to appear before the commitee to answer queries over the hike in fuel prices. Munyes wrote to the committee indicating that he is in South Sudan on official duty. Addressing the matter, the committe chairperson Gladys Wanga said their report will also show that Munyes has been uncooperative. Last week on Tuesday, the Finance and National Planning Committee which is leading the probe into high fuel prices in the country was granted an additional seven days to dig into fuel costings criteria. The Committtee has been probing the costing of fuel in the last two weeks and has held face to face meetings with 10 stakeholders including the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA), the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Treasury and the Ministry of Petroleum as well as receiving written submissions. The probe by the Committee emanated from a petition which sought to vacate value added tax (VAT) from the costing of fuel products as a means to bring relief to Kenyans.
