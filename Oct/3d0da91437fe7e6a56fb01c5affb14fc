Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi has appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to lift the 10pm to 4am curfew instituted as one of the measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. Mudavadi, speaking on Sunday in Nyamira County during the burial of lawyer Evans Monari, said a majority of Kenyans are suffering because of the curfew. According to the ANC leader, the curfew is only serving to further aggravate the economic hardships Kenyans are already facing amidst the pandemic. The ANC leader, however, acknowledged that despite the prevalence rate going down, COVID-19 still very much exists within the country’s borders. He hence urged Kenyans to still continue adhering to the regulations instituted by the government through the Ministry of Health. “Nataka nitume ujumbe kupitia kwa Fred Matiang’i…kweli tumepigwa sana na janga la COVID, na hata hapa tusiseme limeenda, bado liko…kile naomba tu, kupitia kwa Fred Matiang’i, akipata nafasi amshawishi rais wa jamhuri la Kenya kwamba tuzidi kuzingatia COVID rules lakini curfew tu (iondolewe),” he said.
