By Winnie Wangechi A section of Nandi elders on Monday visited the home of slain Kenyan olympian Agnes Tirop for a cleansing ceremony. The event happened at Tirop’s home where she is alleged to have been murdered by her husband Ibrahim Rotich who has since been arrested. The Kaplel clan elders, led by Kirwa Bitok, slaughtered sheep and cleansed the house. Mr. Bitok said that the ritual is meant to make the home, which is a crime scene, hospitable to the rest of Tirop’s family members to live after the incidence. “We have expelled the bad spirits and the house is now ready for anyone to live in as our tradition dictates,” Mr. Bitok said.
