Kenya’s record champions Gor Mahia have been handed a second Fifa transfer ban this year after once again failing to pay a former player his dues. Fifa has ruled that Gor Mahia cannot register any new players until it has paid just over  Sh3 million to Ghana’s Owusu Jackson. On Tuesday, the club signed new players, Austin Odhiambo and Yusuf Mainge, both from AFC Leopards  ahead of Fifa imposing its latest transfer ban last evening. The previous ban imposed by Fifa ran from February until September, when  the club settled the dues of Dickson Ambundo, Shafique Batambuze and coach Steve Pollack. This latest ruling came after the 19-time league winners failed to transfer funds to Jackson within 45 days of being expressly ordered to do so by Fifa’s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC). Following Jackson’s request on Tuesday to Fifa to thus issue a sanction, football’s world governing body followed through with action.

The ban will be lifted as soon as the club, which took to crowd-funding last year in a bid to assuage its financial crisis, pays Jackson all his dues. The transfer ban cannot last more than three windows, following which the matter can go back to Fifa’s Disciplinary Committee for further possible sanctions. Earlier this year, Gor Mahia signed players despite its Fifa transfer ban, stating that the new arrivals would only be registered once their sanction had been lifted.
