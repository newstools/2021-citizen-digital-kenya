Four people accused of witchcraft were on Sunday burned to death in Bomokana village in Kitutu Chache, Kisii County. The four were accused of being behind the bewitching of a high school student, with police now having arrested four suspects in connection with the killings. An amateur video clip taken by one of the residents shows residents gathering next to charred remains of the three people who were killed over allegations of practising witchcraft in the area. According to Kisii Deputy County Commissioner Patrick Muriira, the three were lynched after a 17-year-old high student who mysteriously lost his hearing ability recovered and claimed that they had bewitched him. “Ilikuwa ni kitendo so unfortunate, wananchi wameamka wakasema ni wachawi wakaweza kuwavamia, tumechukua hatua na ku-arrest watu wanne lakini bado tunatafuta wengine,” said Muriira. He warned residents against taking law into their hands, urging them to present any suspected witch doctor to police who are mandated by law to take legal action.
