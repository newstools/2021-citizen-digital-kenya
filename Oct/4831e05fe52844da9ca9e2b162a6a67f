Nzoia Sugar FC tactician Ibrahim Shikanda is confident his side will bag maximum points when they take on Sofapaka in their next FKF Premier League fixture on Friday. Nzoia lost 1-0 to Ulinzi Stars in their opening match of the 2021/22 season,  just before the international break and Shikanda says they cannot afford to falter in their second, at home in Bungoma. Speaking exclusively to Citizen Digital, the coach underlined his respect for Sofapaka but is not allowing the veneration to diminish their hunger for a win. “They have very good players and a very able technical bench. Good news is that we will have 11 versus 11 on the pitch,” he said. His concern is the attacking department, and has rallied his strikers to be ruthless in front of Sofapaka’s goal come Friday. “We really need to score goals, we need to push hard in our Friday assignment against Sofapaka, we have to pocket the three points at any cost, my boys have had enough time to prepare following the international break,” he said.
