Nine prisoners have escaped from custody at the Bomet Police Station after cutting the metal grills at the back of the cells. Bomet Central sub-county police boss Musa Omar Imamai said the nine escapees – 5 adults and 4 juveniles – managed to squeeze themselves out using the small opening they had created. The prisoners had been accused of committing various offenses and were set to appear in court on Monday. Mr. Imamai said one of the escapees has since been re-arrested and is helping police with information likely to lead to the arrest of others. “Bomet and Kericho prisons don’t have a facility for juveniles, so juvenile prisoners held or having pending cases before court are held in stations instead of the prison, that’s why we had the four in our custody ,” said the police boss. He added that the matter is under investigation to ascertain how the inmates managed to cut the grills without officers on duty noticing.
