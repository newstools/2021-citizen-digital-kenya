A Nakuru court on Tuesday directed that fake ‘magistrate’ Victor Kiprono Ng’eno remains in police custody for 14 more days pending completion of police probe. Ng’eno was arraigned before Senior Resident Magistrate Rose Obata and charged with obtaining money by false pretenses and impersonation. The investigating officer told the court that after arresting the suspect, several other complainants were lodged against him, some even outside Nakuru. The officer added that Ng’eno has still not yet fully identified himself, had his fingerprints taken or been subjected to an identification parade. The prosecution sought to have the suspect detained for 14 days to allow the police conduct their investigations. Magistrate Obata, in her ruling, allowed for the detention period saying the matter will be mentioned on October 26, 2021for further direction.

He is said to have reached out to the victim promising to expedite the determination of an ongoing civil case against him, that he was privy to, in his favour. During the course of the next few months after that meeting, Ng’eno would proceed to obtain Ksh.1,664,230 from the victim amidst fake assurances about the case. The victim, however, one day visited the courts and enquired about Ng’eno, only to be told that nobody by that name was a judicial officer, let alone a magistrate, in the county.
