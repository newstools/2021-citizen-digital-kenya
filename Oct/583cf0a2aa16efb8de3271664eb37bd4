Gor Mahia assistant coach Sammy ‘Pamzo’ Omollo expects the newly signed AFC Leopards duo to easily fit in their team, terming their arrival as strategic moves. Pamzo says midfielder Austin Odhiambo has been on their radar for the last two seasons and his inclusion in the squad is a good replacement for Burkinabe midfielder Abdul Karim who left the club, while Yusuf Mainge is set to be the alternative for their only right-back Philemon Otieno. The former Gor Mahia player also revealed they are done with transfers after attaining their target of 25 players for this season. “The two players are very good replacements for some who left. Mainge will assist our only right back Philemon Otieno who has been overplayed while Odhiambo will be a good replacement for midfielder Abdul Karim,’’ explained Pamzo. He added: “Our target was to have a total of 25 players and we are already there. We are thus doing no more signings. If we will need more players, we shall talk about it in the coming season and not now.” The immediate former Posta Rangers coach however explained that Mainge and Odhiambo may not feature in the CAF Confederations Cup early stages following their late arrival.
