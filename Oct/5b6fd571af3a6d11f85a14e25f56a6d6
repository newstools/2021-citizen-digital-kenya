Kisumu Lady Bucks head coach Michael Dave has blamed the closure of Kisumu Show Grounds for their woes in the basketball women’s Premier League. The self-sponsored club has lost the only four matches they have played this season, and are yet to honour any away fixture due to lack of funds. Cumulatively, Bucks have not honoured six away fixtures, but even worse according to Dave, it has been difficult to get the best from his players who train individually as they wait for feedback from schools they wrote to through the County Government, requesting for training venues. “We wrote to the County Government and federation requesting for the facility we can use for training. They closed the sports ground and right now no activity is going on there. If they can’t open for us, we plead that they use their influence and network to help us get training facilities because we are unable as a club to get one,” Dave said. He added: “We have talked to schools requesting they allow us to play in their facilities, but they are very rigid and doesn’t want to hear anything. The County Government has taken our plea positively and added weight in our requests to the schools, so that we can begin proper training. As at now we rely on individual training,” Dave added. His sentiments have been echoed by team captain Jacinta Adhiambo, noting they have gone through untold hardships in the Premier League.

We are hoping to find a solution soon, because under the current situation it is not easy to make any impact,” Adhiambo said.
