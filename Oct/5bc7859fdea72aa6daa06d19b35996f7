The Alcohol Beverages Association of Kenya (ABAK) is pushing to have bars open until 9pm. According to the liquor traders’ representative, a further two hours of operations by bars and other entertainment joints will serve to cushion the hit on the industry. The Association is backing its push on the recent fall in the COVID-19 positivity rate which has averaged below five per cent. ABAK reckons the further easing of restrictions to the operations of liquor traders will serve to create more employment opportunities, aid the recovery of business costs, support manufacturing and keep consumers away from illicit brews. “Given the negative socio-economic situation, the alcohol industry is currently going through increased youth unemployment rates and crime in Kenya. We humbly request for a review of COVID-19 measures restricting bar operation and allowing bars to operate for two additional hours,” ABAK said in a statement on Thursday. Currently, bars are only allowed to operate until 7pm with only restaurants getting the nod to stay open until one hour to the nationwide 10pm curfew.

For instance, ABAK said the demand for millet and sorghum grain has tumbled representing an equivalent Ksh.650 million loss of income accruing to farmers since the pandemic’s hit last year. At the same time, ABAK says the number of Keg bars has reduced from 25,000 outlets to 16,000 outlets resulting to an estimated loss of 45,000 jobs.
