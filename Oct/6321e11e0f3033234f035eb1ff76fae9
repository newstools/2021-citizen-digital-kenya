Vihiga Bullets FC have unveiled seven new talents in a bid to beef up their squad after earning promotion to the top-tier league. The recruits include former Vihiga United duo of skipper Patrick Okulo and midfielder Mike Sabwa alongside Ugandan Joseph Ajuba. Others include Anthony Nsibei from Westidies Eldoret, Moffart Liuva from Kakamega Homeboyz, midfielder Martin Oduor from Kisumu All Stars, and Mike Simiyu from Gusii United. According to head coach Evans Mafuta, the new signings will bolster their squad at the resumption of the FKF-PL over the weekend. “The seven talents we have signed will be instrumental in our league assignments this season, said Mafuta. The youthful tactician (Mafuta) who took over from Edward Manoah who resigned after leading the club to the top-flight had earlier identified areas that needed beefing up. He had singled out goalkeeping, defense and attack as his major areas of concern. “The management is working on other crucial matters such as payments. Mine is to prepare the team for the tasks ahead.’’ Also Read: The team finished second in the National Super League (NSL) last season behind Talanta FC hence earning direct promotion to the FKF Premier League.
