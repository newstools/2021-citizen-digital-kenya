The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has indicated that it is planning to register 20 new voters at the much-contested Migingo island before the end of the ongoing 30-day exercise. Nyatike sub-county election manager Neville Okumu said they are going to hold voter registration exercise at the island, asserting that they are currently working on an effective plan. Mr. Okumu said IEBC is aware of the controversy at the island hence is working closely with security officers in Kenya before holding the registration exercise. He said the commission is in constant communication with the security officers in Migori County and they are optimistic that all the necessary issues will be addressed before they can have the voter registration exercise at the island. The sub-county election manager said they previously faced a few challenges during a similar exercise at Migingo island, but the stalemate was eventually unlocked and they managed to do registration. Migingo island currently has 36 registered voters. Also Read: Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
