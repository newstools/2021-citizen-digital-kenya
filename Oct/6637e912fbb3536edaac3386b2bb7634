Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations on Sunday shot dead a suspected criminal said to have been robbing city residents at gunpoint. DCI, in a statement, said two of the deceased criminal’s accomplices fled the scene with gunshot wounds. The detectives reportedly received a tip off about an ongoing robbery at Harmony area where the gang is said to have pitched camp and was attacking residents “with reckless abandon.” Sleuths based at the Dandora station responded and arrived on scene as the thugs were attacking a woman who was headed home. “The cornered thugs whose party had just been ruined opened fire towards the fast advancing officers as they fled the scene,” read the statement. “But the officers response was fierce and precise, leaving the brave suspect fatally wounded.” Also Read: The other two suspects are said to have dived into a sewer channel and swum through the sludges towards Njiru, with the sleuths still on their trail.
