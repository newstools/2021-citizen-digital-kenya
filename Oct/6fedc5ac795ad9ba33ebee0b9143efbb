Masten Millimo Wanjala, the self-confessed serial killer behind the murder of more than 10 minors, has escaped from police custody. Wanjala was being held at Jogoo Road Police Station in Nairobi when he escaped. According to a police report on the incident, it is the officer who reported on duty at 7am on Wednesday who noticed that Wanjala was missing.
