Bandari FC head coach Andre Casa Mbungo believes that the three friendly matches they played during the international break will inspire his boys to perform well when the league resumes over the weekend. The Dockers sunk Tanzanian Premier League side Coastal Union 3-0 yesterday, after defeating SS Assad and Mariakani United earlier last week. “I want to thank the management who planned the friendlies which have been of big importance to us and we hope to extend the winning streak when the league restart,” said Casa Mbungo. Ugandan attacker William Wadri scored a brace as speedy winger Benjamin Mosha added another one. The former AFC Leopards tactician has at the same breath heaped praise to his new signings, saying they have quickly settled in at the club. Bandari, who are topping the log after match round one, will be away against Bidco United on Friday.

In another round two fixture on Friday, Nzoia Sugar will play host to Sofapaka FC as new entrants Vihiga Bullets face mailmen Posta Rangers.
