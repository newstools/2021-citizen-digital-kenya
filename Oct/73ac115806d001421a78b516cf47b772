Football Kenya Federation Premier League side Bandari FC will  today host their Tanzanian counterparts Coastal Union FC of Tanga in an international friendly match at Mbaraki Sports ground. According to Bandari team manager Albert Ogari, the dockers will use the friendly to prepare for their weekend league match against Bidco United as Union also train their sights on a league meeting with Ruvu Shooting in Tanzania’s mainland league. “We are playing our last friendly match to regain our match fitness levels,” explained Ogai. According to Ogari, facing the Melis Medo coached side will offer them a good test as they aim to shake off the rustiness that may have been occasioned by the international break. “Medo has revamped his squad which has not lost in their two opening matches thus we know they will give us good fitness as they also prepare for their league to resume after the international break.” The dockers will welcome back defender Sosthenes Idah who joined the Tanga-based side on a one year deal.

For several years, Bandari and Coastal Union have been meeting in friendly matches especially during the off-season period with Bandari winning 1-0 in the last outing in 2019 in Tanga. Bandari have already played two friendlies during the international break, defeating SS Assad and Mariakani United 2-1 and 6-1 respectively. The table toppers defeated Mathare united 3-0 in the only league match and after the Bidco match, they are scheduled to play three consecutive home matches at home.
