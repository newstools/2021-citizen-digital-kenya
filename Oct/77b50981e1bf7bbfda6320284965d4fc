The government has declared Monday October 11, 2021 as a public holiday. This is according to a public statement released on Wednesday by Interior & Coordination of National Government Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang’i. Dr. Matiang’i said Monday becomes a public holiday by virtue of the fact that Utamaduni Day falls on a Sunday, October 10. “Whereas this day is already conferred by law, this shall be the first time that Utamaduni Day is observed in Kenya and this press release serves to emphasize the need for all citizens to recognize and celebrate the rich cultural diversity of Kenya in a manner that promotes unity, national cohesion and economic progress in the Country,” stated the CS.
