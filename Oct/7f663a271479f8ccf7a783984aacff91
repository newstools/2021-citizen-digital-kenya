Strathmore Blades head coach Tony Ochieng has challenged his team to build on last weekend’s double wins as they face hosts Kismu Lakeside on Sunday. Ochieng acknowledges Lakeside have been tough opponents for them in the men’s basketball Premier League, but have devised a formula to stop them in the forthcoming clash. The coach wants to capitalise on the technical flaws he has identified in recent games by Lakeside to beat them at their backyard. “The team is in great mood after winning twice last weekend. We have fixed all the departments that we needed to work on so tactically we know how Kisumu are, essentially we are ready for them. “When they are at home, they are quite stubborn. We will have to stop their ball flow and penetration,” Ochieng noted. So far, Blades are seventh in the league with 14 points after nine games, winning five and losing four while Lakeside are ninth with 13 after 10 games, having won three and lost seven.

All odds are against us. We try to control their transitions, but importantly be comfortable psychologically to face them without fearing their records,” Kalman said. The students are third on the log with 21 points after 14 games, winning seven and losing seven. The soldiers who are the defending champs are at the top of the log with 27 points, having played 14 games, winning 13 and losing one only.
