Football Kenya Federation (FKF) stadia headache continues as the Premier League resumes after the international break, as Nairobi’s main venues Nyayo National Stadium and Moi International Sports Kasarani are unavailable. With an extra Nairobi team in the top league – Kenya Police, who were in the National Super League (NSL) last season, FKF are left with no choice but to stage matches of the now 11 teams from the region at Utalii and Ruaraka Grounds only. Nairobi based clubs are Talanta FC, AFC Leopards, Gor Mahia, Mathare United, Kariobangi Sharks, Nairobi City Stars, KCB, Tusker, Wazito FC, Posta Rangers and Police. FKF CEO Barry Otieno has appealed to the Ministry of Sports to open Nyayo Sadium for them, which is currently hosting international matches only. “It is not our mistake to use Ruaraka and Utalii Grounds only, but those are the available venues, for now,” Otieno told Citizen Digital on Wednesday. “We hope they (Ministry of Sports) will hear our plea and give us the stadium as it will help teams based in Nairob. We don’t have any other options and matches must be played, so all matches will continue to be played at the two venues until a solution is found.” Also Read: FKF-PL sides Bandari FC, Vihiga Bullets, Soafapaka FC, Ulinzi Stars, Kakamega Homeboyz, Nzoia Sugar and Bidco United play their matches outside Nairobi. Thika Stadium, home to Bidco, has been an alternative to Utalii and Ruaraka, with coaches decrying the poor state of the three venues escalated by their overuse. A number of venues are under construction within Nairobi, including the Ulinzi Sports Complex in Lang’ata and the Jamhuri Sports Complex. Dandora Stadium however stalled due to a court case, while Machakos Stadium which was the go to venue for most Nairobi based clubs was converted to a COVID-19 Centre and is yet to get back to hosting matches.
