Kakamega Homeboyz chairman Cleophas Shimanyula believes their attacking department is sharper than last season, despite the retirement of experienced striker Allan Wanga. Homeboyz also lost attacking midfielder Shami Kibwana who joined Tusker at the beginning of the season, but the arrival of former Bandari man Yema Mwana and Nigerian Michael Kumor gives Shimanyula the confidence that the equation has been balanced. “We now have two striking specialists, Mwana wand there is another one by the name  Kumor from Western Stima. Our strikers have not been scoring goals and that is why most of our goals last season were netted by our midfielders. “I can however assure you that the problem has been dealt with after signing these two no-nonsense strikers,” noted Shimanyula. The Bernard Mwalala coached side have already started life without the former Harambee Stars and AFC Leopards goal poacher, and Shimanyula hopes that Mwana and Kumor’s partnership will be beautiful to behold. “This time we are organised even after Wanga retired and that is why we have keenly gone to the market to sign only those players who will be helpful to us. We have a mixture of experienced players and youthful ones and in fact the strikers we have signed are sharper than Wanga. Also Read: “The fact that we have only lost one player by the name Shami Kibwana to Tusker, it shows that we have managed to keep our first team squad plus a few additions and now the team is ready to challenge for the league title this season without doubt,” Shimanyula concluded. Homeboyz started the new campaign with a hard fought 1-0 win against new boys Kenya Police at Bukhungu stadium before the international break.
