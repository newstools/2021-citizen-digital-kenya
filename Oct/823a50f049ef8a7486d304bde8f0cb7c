Eintracht Frankfurt subjected Bayern Munich to a first 2-1 league defeat at the Allianz Arena in 30 matches. Filip Kostic struck seven minutes from time as Frankfurt secured a first win of the season and first at Bayern since 2000. Leon Goretzka scored in the first half, but Frankfurt captain Martin Hinteregger quickly hit back. Bayern, last beaten at home in November 2019, remain top of the Bundesliga, one point ahead of Borussia Dortmund. They took the lead just before the half hour mark. Goretzka latched on to Robert Lewandowski’s throw ball and steered in his first goal of the season. Just two minutes later, Hinteregger was left unmarked in the box and powered a header past Manuel Neuer to restore parity.
