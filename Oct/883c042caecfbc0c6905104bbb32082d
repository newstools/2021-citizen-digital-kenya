Straight from the Morocco debacle where a hapless Harambee Stars were clobbered 5-0 by hosts Mali in a Group E World Cup qualifier, beleaguered federation chief Nick Mwendwa has on Saturday unveiled a new partner, a gaming firm, as a new partner for the national football team Harambee Stars. The event took place at the Nyayo National Stadium. The partnership, according to the federation, will cover the remainder of the World Cup qualifying campaign and started with the Stars’ away game in Agadir, Morocco against Mali. As part of the deal, FKF says it will get Sh3 million from the online gaming firm to prepare the team for the remaining qualifiers against Mali, Rwanda, and Uganda. “We believe in supporting Kenyan football. We have been working at grass root level but we have always wanted to work with the national team and this is our time,” said Mozzart General Manager Saša Krneta. FKF President Nick Mwendwa thanked the firm for their support. Also Read: “Thank you for believing in Kenyan football, and for believing in the Harambee Stars. We were able to send the team to Morocco comfortably and we thank you for that.” “We did not get the result we wanted in Agadir but I believe in this team, I know its potential and I am sure better results are on the way.” “We have a chance to make a statement in the remaining matches, and I am confident that we can get a positive result in the end if we give it all as a team,” he added. The Harambee Stars face Mali on Sunday, October 9, 2021, at the Nyayo National Stadium starting at 4 pm, and thereafter Uganda and Rwanda in the final round of qualifiers in November.
