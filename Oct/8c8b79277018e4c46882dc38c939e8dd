Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru says the reason she is not running for presidency in the upcoming 2022 elections is because she does not have enough funds to run a presidential campaign. According to Waiguru, she would require Ksh.5 billion to campaign for the country’s top job. “I am not standing for the presidency because I don’t have Ksh.5 billion. You know you need time and I don’t want to waste people’s time,” Waiguru said in interview with Daily Nation. “People say they want to run for presidency but what they really want is the deputy presidency or governor of Nairobi,” she said. In the interview, the Governor, however, hinted that she might run for the highest office in the next polls in 2027. “It will depend on what the ground is saying. I will probably give a shot at the presidency or deputy after finishing my second term as governor,” said Waiguru.

I am not naïve, but I want to believe the people will be mature and civil,” she said. On Sunday, PS Kibicho however said the national celebrations committee had given Waiguru’s office 300 invitation cards. Kibicho said that the other leaders, including the woman representative, got five cards each. He said Waiguru has been fully involved in the ceremony’s preparations in a WhatsApp forum where communication was being done.
