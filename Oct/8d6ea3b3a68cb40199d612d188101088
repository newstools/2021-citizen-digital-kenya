Kenya has received a bilateral donation of 160,000 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine from Slovakia, as well as 700,000 doses from France and Germany donated via the COVAX Facility. This takes the tally for Kenya from Europe, including COVAX deliveries to over 2 million doses. “Slovakia has heard the loud and clear calls for vaccine justice,” pointed out Slovak Ambassador Katarina Žuffa Leligdonová. “The pandemic can only be overcome if we join forces together. The Slovak government already provided 50 000 pieces of diagnostic tests and 20 000 face masks in July 2020, to mitigate the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in Kenya. This time, Slovakia is joining EU family in Nairobi, providing 160 000 Astra Zeneca vaccines. It brings the overall Slovak contribution to Kenya in the context of fighting the pandemic up to KES 87 million.” French Chargé d’Affaires Lionel Fabre said: “Our delivery of 700 000 vaccines, in addition to the vaccines already delivered by other EU Member States under the Team Europe banner, will help save lives, help build herd immunity to Covid-19 and soon ensure a return to a more normal life. Speaking on Germany’s behalf, Deputy Ambassador Thomas Wimmer said on the occasion: “In a global pandemic, no one is safe until everyone is safe. Together, Germany and France have provided more than KES 308 billion for the global pandemic response through COVAX. Today’s arrival of a French and German vaccine donation shows that COVAX works, and that Team Europe as a whole is committed to vaccine equality.” Also Read: Europe has already delivered nearly 70 million vaccines free globally and commits to deliver 200 million by December 25, this year. The vaccine doses were handed over to Ambassador Arthur Adambi, Director for Middle East and COVID-19 Coordinator at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as senior officials from the Ministry of Health. In June, France supplied 180,000 vaccines and oxygen supply plant systems, with Germany supplying mobile Covid testing labs in 2020 and 900,000 surgical masks in 2021 to Kenya.
