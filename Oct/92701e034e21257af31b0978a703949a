Police officers in Moyale are holding the suspected mastermind of a motorbike theft syndicate and his accomplice. The sleuths recovered 350 motorcycle logbooks, number plates, assorted sales agreements and delivery notes from a house belonging to the suspected mastermind, 24-year-old Isaack Hassan. Hassan alongside his accomplice, Mohammed Ibrahim (24), were nabbed while attempting to escape the police dragnet. The DCI, in a statement to newsrooms, said the arrest followed a previous raid in Eastleigh where a number of new motorbikes that had reportedly been stolen from a warehouse in Industrial Area were recovered. “The discovery followed the disappearance of a motorbike in western Kenya, that was tracked down to the Eastleigh store where other used motorcycles were also recovered,” stated the DCI. “Detectives have established that motorbikes stolen from various parts of the country, find their way to the upper Eastern and North Eastern counties where they’re sold to bandits for a song. Others find their way into countries neighboring those counties.” Also Read: The suspects are being detained at the Moyale Police Station awaiting arraignment.
