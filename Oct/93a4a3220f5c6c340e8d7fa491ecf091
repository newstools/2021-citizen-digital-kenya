The notes to be listed at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) have a tenure of five years with a fixed yield of 12.25 per cent per year to be paid every six months. The offer opened to investors on Wednesday and is expected to close on October 21 while the subsequent listing of the notes on the NSE will occur on November 1. Proceeds from the new corporate bond issue will be deployed in the settlement of specific short-term borrowings by EABL alongside the firm up of working capital.
