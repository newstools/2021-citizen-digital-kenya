Each of the three petitioners will receive a compensation of Ksh.10 million. Simon Ng’ang’a was the CEC for Water and Environment, Faith Mbugua was in charge of Education while Muthoni Wamuiya headed the Industrialization and Trade department. Governor Kimemia dropped them from his Cabinet after failing to renew their contracts.
