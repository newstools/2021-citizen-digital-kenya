Kenya will know its fate on the escalating maritime border conflict with Somalia on Tuesday, October 12 as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issues its verdict. Somalia had sued Kenya at the International Court of Justice for what it said was unlawful operations in its maritime territory along the Indian Ocean. Already Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Amb. Macharia Kamau has stated that Kenya will not recognize the court’s ruling terming it a product of a flawed judicial process that they had withdrawn from. “The delivery of the Judgment will be the culmination of a flawed judicial process that Kenya has had reservations with, and withdrawn from, on account not just of its obvious and inherent bias but also of its unsuitability to resolve the dispute at hand,” said Foreign Affairs PS Amb. Macharia Kamau in a press briefing on Friday. Macharia accused the court of bias saying it did not have the force to resolve the dispute. “Kenya has been and continues to thrive as a beacon of peace and stability in the region and beyond… It is in this context that Kenya had maintained – even before Somalia filed the current case – that any dispute between the two countries regarding their maritime boundary should be resolved through amicable negotiations. Also Read: In fact, in 2009, the two countries entered into an agreement on how and when to amicably address matters concerning the maritime boundary,” the Ministry added. Mogadishu had demanded a review of the maritime border amid protests by Kenya which had urged the court to suspend the hearing of the matter until the COVID-19 pandemic is contained. The unresolved maritime boundary dispute started in 2014, and  has since threatened the relationship between the two East African neighbours. Attempts by IGAD and the African Union to mediate were unsuccessful. Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
