Despite the strong wind that has denied the players a better play as was the case in the opening round where eight players shot under par scores, Golf Park’s David Wakhu shot one under par 70 in the second round of the Great Rift leg of the 2021 Safari Tour series to tie with Day One leader Greg Snow on three under par 139, at the par 71 Great Rift Valley Golf Resort course on Monday. Wakhu said his plan was to go easy to make sure that he makes the second round cut as he registered the only under score for the day, with a level par 71 by Jacob Okello and Nelson Mudanyi, who both missed cut and Rwanda’s Alloys Nsabimana being the second best. “My plans were just to hang in there and try to see if I can make cut because apparently from the earlier Safari Tour I have been struggling a lot, I have been having a lot of problems with my body in terms of fatigue. I have been working hard in the gym, and I think I grinded too much and its holding me back but I know in few events to come I’ll be good.” said Wakhu. Wakhu started off with a birdie at the first hole, dropped a shot at the fourth and sixth but birdied the 12th and 14th to eventually to  catch up with the Muthaiga player Snow who bogeyed eight holes against five birdies for the day’s two over par 73 and a two rounds total of 139. Meanwhile, senior pro Dismas Indiza shot one over par 72 to move to third place on 141 dropping five shots and it was only his two birdies and an eagle three which saved the day for him. A total of 20 players made it the six over par cut to proceed to the third and fourth rounds where the winner will take home Sh230,000 depending on how many under par scores he will be able to post.
