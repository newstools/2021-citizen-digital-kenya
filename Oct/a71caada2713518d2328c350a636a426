AFC Leopards are on stand-by to sign ex-Zesco United striker John Makwata once they get clearance from Fifa. A source at the club confirmed that the striker could rejoin them once Ingwe gets clearance from Fifa. “Makwatta has been training with us and he is one of our primary targets,” the source within the club’s hierarchy revealed. “Since we lost Elvis Rupia our priority is to get a top-class and experienced centre-forward. Don’t you think Makwatta fits the bill? “Remember Makwatta was our player before he left for Zambia and his contributions to the club is there for anyone to see and if he finally joins us, I think it will be the best decision for both parties.” AFC Leopards – who lost 17 players before the season began have not signed any new players since Fifa sanctioned them for their failure to settle debts owed to former coach Andre Casa Mbungo and players Vincent Habanmahoro, Soter Kayumba, and Tressor Ndikumana.
