 Keiyo South Member of the National Assembly Daniel Rono wants a police post set up at Iten training camp in Elgeiyo Marakwet County, to ensure there is maximum security for both local and foreign athletics training in the area. The legislator says Iten high altitude training camp and Kaptagat training camps have been hosting local and foreign athletes, among them the world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge. Other training camps in the area the MP wants guarded include Kapkitony, and Kapsait camps in Marakwet West. He said beefing up security in the area will create a smooth training environment for athletes. “These are our good will ambassadors  and  the country  should  reciprocate  them   by  providing  enabling   environment  for training, ” said Rono . The 2019 Standard Marathon champion and  2020 runner-up  Brimin  Kipkorir  Misoi  has backed the legislator’s calls adding that currently, the nearest police station from the camp is six kilometers away, exposing athletes to security risk.

He hinted at plans to table a bill in parliament in order for athletes to have funds set aside for improvement of training grounds and to cater for their welfare alongside helping them in retirement. “Our athletes are our ambassadors and it is proper for the government to protect them for flying the Kenyan flag across the globe,” he said. The MP says it will be prudent to have the funds set aside to encourage more youth to join ‘this lucrative sporting industry’. He warned athletes training in the area to ensure their safety by running only in designated areas to avoid unnecessary injuries.
