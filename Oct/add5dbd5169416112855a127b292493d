Masten Millimo Wanjala, the self-confessed serial killer behind the murders of more than 10 minors took advantage of a curfew confusion at the Jogoo Road police station to escape. On Tuesday night, sources at the station say police officers arrested a big number of curfew violators and brought them to the station. “They had arrested many people who were outside past curfew hours and they all could not be put at the holding areas,” says the police source who refused to be named. “This forced the officers to put the violators inside the cells where Masten was being held.” Masten was killed by an irate mob at Mukhweya village, Bungoma, on Friday, just three  days after he escaped. At dawn, police officers decided to release the curfew violators and in the confusion, he mingled with them and managed to flee where it was discovered hours later that he was missing. Three police officers — Police Inspector Philip Mbithi and Police Constables Boniface Mutuma and Precious Mwende — were arrested accused of allegedly aiding Milimo’s escape.

After escaping from the station, Milimo is said to have hitched a ride on a cargo trailer and that is how he managed to travel all the way to Bungoma. On Friday morning, Milimo was walking around his village when he came across school going children who know him and they raised alarm. They alerted a few people one of them being boda boda rider who went and reported the matter to the police. However, by the time the police got to him, he was already dead, having being lynched by villagers. Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
