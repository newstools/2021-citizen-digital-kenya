A Ugandan national has been arrested by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) over the alleged killing of a 25-year-old woman in Nyali. The foreigner, Suleiman Mayanja, is said to have entered Kenya through the border point in Busia sometime last month. He was arrested on Monday evening at the Nyali Cinemax where he was reportedly hiding after committing the crime. The suspect is said to have sent a cab driver to collect his belongings from a room he on September 30 booked at Sunny Side apartments. The driver was arrested by detectives who lay in wait, upon which – after interrogation – he led the sleuths to the suspect’s hideout. A police report seen by Citizen Digital said Mayanja, who entered the country on September 1, and the deceased were not well known to each other. Also Read: “They had met a day before at a popular joint, where they made merry and imbibed a few drinks,” read the report. The Monday 3am meeting was only their second, as the deceased joined Mayanja in his apartment where she unfortunately met her demise. The suspect is presently being grilled by police officers awaiting arraignment. The deceased’s half-dressed body was discovered by a guard at the apartment conducting a routine patrol. She had allegedly been thrown off the apartment’s bedroom balcony. Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
