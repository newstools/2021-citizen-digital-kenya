Kenyan police said on Thursday they were asking the husband of distance runner Agnes Tirop, a two-times World Championship bronze medallist who was found dead at her home, to come forward. Police said on Wednesday that Tirop appeared to have been stabbed in the neck with a knife. The 25-year-old represented Kenya in the 5,000 metres at the Tokyo Olympics and finished fourth in the finals. “We are now urging Ibrahim Rotich, husband to the late Kenyan athlete to present himself to the nearest police station or security agency to assist police with their investigations,” Tom Makori, sub county police commander for Keiyo North, told Reuters by telephone. “We have not arrested the suspect by Thursday, but we have some information which can lead us for his arrest.” Last month, Tirop smashed the women-only 10km world record in Germany, crossing the line in 30:01 to shave 28 seconds from the previous record held by Morocco’s Asmae Leghzaoui from 2002.
