Gor Mahia on Friday begun their CAF Confederations campaign on sound footing with a 3-1 win over Al Ahly Merowe FC of Sudan in Suez, Egypt. Merowe were the first to score in the 41st minute, capitalising on a Gor defensive mix-up. The two teams went to the breather with the 1-0 score-line. In the second half, rejuvenated K’Ogalo came back roaring with Samwel Onyango canceling Merowe’s advantage in the 56th minute. Gor took control of the proceedings, paid off as youthful striker Benson Omalla made it 2-1 in the 66th minute. Four minutes later, Burundian import Jules Ulimwengu completed the party with a beautiful goal to give Gor a deserving 3-1 away advantage. Gor will need to avoid losing by more than two goals to progress to the next round when the two teams lock horns in the second leg slated for next week in Nairobi.
