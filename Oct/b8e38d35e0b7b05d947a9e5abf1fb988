British world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury says his achievements in the sport have already made him a boxing “great” and that his love of fighting is what motivates him to continue. The unbeaten 33-year-old defends his WBC title against American Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas over the weekend. It will be their third fight after a draw in 2018 before Fury gained a seventh-round win in the 2020 rematch. “If I didn’t have any more fights I would not regret anything,” said Fury. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Boxing podcast, he added: “I’m not fighting to be the greatest of all time, I’m not fighting to be a legend. “It wouldn’t benefit me earning another £50m or £200m, you don’t need to be rich to live my life – I’m just a normal person who is very good at boxing and a very special, chosen person.
