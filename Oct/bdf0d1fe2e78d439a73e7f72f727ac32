President Uhuru Kenyatta said the nationwide curfew may be lifted soon, while addressing Karatina residents on Monday afternoon, on his way to Kirinyaga where this year’s Mashujaa Day celebrations will be held. The Head of State was responding to calls from area residents who urged him to lift the daily, dusk-to-dawn curfew which has persisted, almost two years since the first COVID-19 case was reported locally. “In the days to come, we will look at it, I’m working, and very soon, you will hear it, I do not want to speak too early but very soon.”Uhuru said. At the same time, Uhuru urged residents to continue following the protocols from the Ministry of Health, to ensure they are safe from the scourge that has devastated the world, killed millions, and sent economies into remission. ” You need to also protect yourself from the disease, so that when we re-open there are no more deaths, and you will be free to live as you want,”he added. “I’m also happy to say that I’m very contented, you know why? Because, these days, you go home early and you are now multiplying, or who do you think will vote tomorrow if you don’t multiply?” Also Read: In an announcement on October 4, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said the daily curfew had been extended for a further 30 days, on account of the high COVID-19 positivity rate.
