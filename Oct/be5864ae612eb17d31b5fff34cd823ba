No casualties were however reported from the incident as nobody was inside the building at the time. The early Sunday morning incident left several cars damaged beyond repair in a nearby garage. An eye witness told Citizen Digital he heard a loud bang at around 3.30am and, together with other watchmen, they ran for their lives. Police are currently at the scene.
