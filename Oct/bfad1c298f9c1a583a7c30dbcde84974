The third leg of the Safari Tour Season 4 series at the 71 Great Rift Valley Golf Resort in Naivasha has come to an end, with Golf Park’s David Wakhu emerging victorious after consistently defending his position at the top of the leaderboard throughout. This is despite bogeying six holes in today’s final round, scoring a total of over par 285 to finish on level par in the opening nine after dropping a shot at the fifth hole. Wakhu won by three shots from Samuel Njoroge who came second, followed closely by Greg Snow but while celebrating his triumph, Wakhu blamed slow play by the teams which played ahead of the last group. “I am so grateful to my caddie Stephen Gachara and his boss Tom Fraser for their help during the week. I wanted an under par final round, but along the way I started putting badly despite having started with a birdie on the first hole which ended up being the only birdie of the round. We had to wait in every hole and that real messed my focus and concentration and my plan to score all under par rounds.’’ said Wakhu. He three putted the 11th, darting his tee shot at the par three 12th then  hit a perfect driver at the par five-14th, but was forced to wait for more than 10 minutes and that was followed by an out of bound approach eight iron shot which resulted in a bogey. He then three-putted the par five-17th and missed a birdie narrowly at the 18th for a five over par 76 and a four rounds total of over par 285 denying him more cash that is usually given as under par scores bonus only for him to take home Sh276,667. Kenya Railway Golf Club’s Samuel Njoroge who was made Wakhu sweat for his cash shot four over par 75 for a total of 288, with round one leader Greg Snow of Muthaiga posting 76 for five over par 289. Youngster Mathew Wahome shot one over par 72 for a total of 290 to finish fourth after being pushed by Rwanda’s Aloys Nsabimana who came in ninth place on 293. Nsabimana is sponsored by Falcon Country Club of Rwanda courtesy of leading amateur golfer in Rwanda, Innocent Rutamu. Malawi’s Paul Chidale shot 78 in the final round to drop to seventh with senior pro Dismas Indiza on 292 while home pro and defending champion Justus Madoya finished third tying with second leg winner Robson Chinhoi of Zimbabwe and Golf Park’s Eric Ooko.
