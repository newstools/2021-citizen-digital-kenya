AFC Leopards chairman Dan Shikanda has pleaded with fans to be good ambassadors for the club, saying negative energy from within the Ingwe family has recently cost them a big deal. According to the former Leopards and Gor Mahia player, the team has lost some of their senior players for the last two seasons because of false reports from different quarters. “It’s painful that the first team we had recruited was scattered by rumours. The same has happened to the second squad we brought together. So what do you do next? Will you continue the same trend or just give up? It is very painful! And then you still demand to have results yet on the other hand you are always trying to destroy,” a frustrated Shikanda said. Although it is essentially financial constraints that led to the exit of 17 players from last season’s Leopards squad, Shikanda feels had there been togetherness, they would have kept them. With a new look team following the exit of the 17, Shikanda is coy to speak of their target this season as they are building a new team altogether. “We shall give a comprehensive statement concerning the team but we wanted our head coach (Patrick Aussems) to look at the squad and see where Tom Juma (assistant coach) had reached with the team while he was away. When we get the report from the technical people on the strengths and weaknesses, then we can set our season targets – the title, mid table place or relegation fight,” he noted.
