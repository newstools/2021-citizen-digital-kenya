The High Court has extended orders prohibiting the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Inspector General of Police from investigating, arresting or charging Justices Said Chitembwe and Aggrey Muchelule. The orders have been extended until February 21 next year when the matter will be mentioned for compliance. At the same time, the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) has been enjoined in the case as an interested party. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in July this year claimed that a total of Ksh.6 million was seized during a raid in which the two judges were arrested. In an affidavit seen by Citizen Digital, Chief Inspector Felix Karisa Banzi said they recovered USD 50,000 from an unidentified lady in Justice Muchelule’s chambers and a further USD 7,000 from Justice Chitembwe. Justice Chitembwe, in response, however said he has three dollar accounts hence it is normal for him to carry money in U.S Dollars. Also Read: He maintained that the USD 7,000 recovered in his possession was his money, and that it was intended for his son’s school fees in Australia. The two judges on July 29, 2021 obtained orders barring the DCI and DPP from arresting and further recommending charges against them pending hearing and determination of the case. Inspector Banzi previously told the court that the DCI had been investigating complaints where select judges and judicial officers were accused of corruption.
