AFC Leopards will sign only five players before the closure of the transfer window, assistant coach Tom Juma has revealed. This is despite losing 17 players due to the financial crisis facing the club, with Juma saying the youth team members they have promoted to the senior side are ready for the task. Three midfielders, a winger and a goal keeper are expected to put pen to paper and link up with the Patrick Ausems coached side. “I can’t give the names now but the new players are joining, the priority number one this season is the league trophy. We performed well last season and want to get even better this season. We are going to bring five on board spread across all the departments. We also want to work with a small number that can be easy to manage in terms of finances. We don’t want to strain,” Juma told Citizen Digital. World football governing body FIFA sanctioned Leopards for their failure to settle debts owed to former coach Andre Casa Mbungo and players Vincent Habanmahoro, Soter Kayumba, and Tressor Ndikumana. However, having collected over 8 million shillings last week during a fund drive, Ingwe are in the process of clearing the debts.
