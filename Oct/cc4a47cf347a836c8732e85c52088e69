Athletics Kenya (AK) has already identified a course that will host the inaugural World Athletics Cross Country Tour. Kenya will host the 14th and final leg of the Cross Country Tour Gold meeting that has been slated for February 12 in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County. According to the federation, a course has been designed at the Lobo Village which is located some 10km from Eldoret town along Kisumu road. AK president Jackson Tuwei said preparations for the event have begun in earnest as Kenya seeks to stage another successful global event. “First, it is an honour for us to host another global event and especially being the only African country to host the gold meeting series. We have got a team that is working on that and has already hit the ground running,” said Tuwei.
