Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) are holding a 32-year-old man for allegedly impersonating a magistrate at the Nakuru Law Courts. Victor Kiprono Ng’eno in 2018 reportedly obtained Ksh.1.6 million from a man in Nakuru while carrying out the ruse. He is said to have reached out to the victim promising to expedite the determination of an ongoing civil case against him, that he was privy to, in his favour. During the course of the next few months after that meeting, Ng’eno would proceed to obtain Ksh.1,664,230 from the victim amidst fake assurances about the case. The victim, however, one day visited the courts and enquired about Ng’eno, only to be told that nobody by that name was a judicial officer, let alone a magistrate, in the county. He then attempted to reach out to Ng’eno but all his efforts hit a brick wall, upon which he resolved to report the matter to DCI detectives in Nakuru.

But before he could fully regain his composure and strike again, his most dreaded moment came when he felt cold metal cuffs massage his wrists yesterday, (Saturday),” read a statement from the DCI. Ng’eno is presently being detained at the Nakuru Police Station awaiting arraignment at the very court that he had lied he was serving at.
