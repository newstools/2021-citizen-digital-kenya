Gor Mahia have jetted out Wednesday morning for their CAF Confederations Cup tie against Sudanese side Al-Ahly Merowe, set for Friday in Suez, Egypt. The travelling party consists of 17 players, six technical staff, three officials and the head of delegation. Gor, who left aboard Egypt Air, are expected to have a feel of the pitch on Thursday in Suez, the temporary home of Merowe whose real home is not approved for CAF matches presently. Long serving goalkeeper Boniface Oluoch has been left out as he is serving his four-match ban by CAF, for roughing up a referee in their last continental duty against Naps Stars of Zambia. Earlier in the week, Gorfirst vice-captain Philemon Otieno had indicated that they are going for nothing short of three points away before sealing the deal in Nairobi. ‘’We respect our opponents but they have no big advantage over us. Both teams have been featuring at the continental competitions and so we are in the same league. Our target is to grab three points away and complete our plan in Nairobi,’’ said Otieno.
