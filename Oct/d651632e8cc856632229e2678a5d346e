Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko, a long-time ally of President Uhuru Kenyatta, has defected to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and declared herself a candidate for the Kajiado gubernatorial seat in 2022. Ms Tobiko vowed to deliver and boost the economy through the bottom-up economic model while welcoming UDA party leader and Deputy President William Ruto to her family farm in Kajiado on Friday. “I will be vying for Kajiado Governor via UDA,” Ms Tobiko said on Friday. “I have come to add value to the party,” she said. “I’m ready to compete with others for the party nominations.” She also used the opportunity to blast incumbent governor, Joseph Ole Lenku, whom she accused of incompetence. “The current governor ameshindwa na kazi, aende nyumbani,” she added. Her audacious declaration, however, was not without drama. Kishanto Ole Suuji, her husband, claimed he was unaware of the meeting and that no permission had been sought from him. “I’m hurt, I do not support what is going on, I don’t support the political activity going in my farm in Kajiado, that is my farm, that is my land,” Mr. Suuji said on Friday. He is also said to have gone to the Isinya police to have the meeting stopped and Mr. Ruto arrested for trespassing on his farm. “That is trespass, my property has been destroyed, my rights have been infringed by Samoei Ruto,” he added. Ms Tobiko, known as the ‘Iron Lady’ in the region, however, downplayed her husband’s statement, vowing to stick to her decision to run for Kajiado’s top seat. “I’m not a coward, some family members were called to address the press that they were not aware of the meeting,” she said on Friday. “I made a decision and will not be stopped. I want to work for the people of Kajiado,” she said Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
