US President Joe Biden will on Thursday host President Uhuru Kenyatta at the White House. According to the White House, Biden and Kenyatta will discuss the trong U.S.-Kenyan bilateral relationship and the need to bring transparency and accountability to domestic and international financial systems. This will be the first time Biden is holding one-on-one talks as president with an African leader. The two leaders are also set to discuss efforts to defend democracy and human rights, advance peace and security, accelerate economic growth, and tackle climate change. “The meeting will build on the leaders’ phone call in February and on President Biden’s commitment to the U.S. partnership with Africa based on principles of mutual respect and equality,” said the White House in a statement issued on Wednesday.
