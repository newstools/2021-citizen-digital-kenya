Businessman Jimi Wanjigi has hit out at Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga saying he should come out and declare if he will run for the presidency in 2022. Wanjigi also condemned those opposed to his move to open ODM offices in the grassroots saying he is popularizing the party in Central Kenya but some forces are fighting him. The businessman also reiterated that he will not leave ODM saying he has invested heavily in the party and expects free and fair party primaries. Wanjigi, who spoke in Mombasa on Saturday, further urged the ODM leadership to conduct elections so as to have genuine members in the party. “Raila cannot be a player, the umpire, the referee, the linesman and the VAR. He should announce his candidature and face all other interested candidates within the party law,” he said. Also Read: Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
