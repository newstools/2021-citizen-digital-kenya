AFC Leopards head coach Patrick Aussems says the current squad is not strong enough to compete for titles this season, and is desperate to sign more before the transfer window closes. Ingwe have lost 17 players to their rivals in the current transfer window, and Aussems has openly said the available players can only fight to remain in the league. Having won their opening match against league champions Tusker FC, Leopards will next face KCB on Saturday but the Belgian who was absent during the match is not deceived by the win. “Last season we introduced some few young players to the senior team and they really impressed in their performance. They were useful against Tusker FC but that alone is not enough, we have to add  more experience in the team if we have to compete with the best the entire season,” said Aussems. The Belgian who was away during the short preseason says it will call for a fresh plan as the entire first team of last season is no longer at the den. He is however not throwing in the towel before he faces the Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno side.

I expect a tough encounter against a wounded side (KCB) that lost to Gor but the players are once again determined to fight for the three points,” added Aussems Aussems has however told MadGoat TV that he is committed to the club, despite the enormous setbacks. “I signed new contract because I’m committed to this club, I feel respected and loved that why I came back.  I want to help them win titles and earn the respect they deserve, so long as we stick to the long-term project we want to do.” Leopards are yet to be allowed by world football governing body FIFA to sign new players, until they pay some of their former players and coach (Cassa Mbungo now of Bandari FC) their monies.
