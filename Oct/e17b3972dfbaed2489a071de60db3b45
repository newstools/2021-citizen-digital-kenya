Police officers in Nyamira County are investigating an incident where a man allegedly killed his wife before committing suicide. The lifeless bodies of  George Nyauma Asiba, 51, and Mary Kwamboka, 42, were found in the bedroom of their house on Wednesday. According to a police report seen by Citizen Digital, the body of the woman was found on the bed, with a head injury “probably inflicted by a blunt object.” The man’s body, on the other hand, was found dangling from the roof of the bedroom with a mosquito net tied around his neck. The report stated that a suicide note found on scene allegedly written by the man suggested that he had found out his wife had an extra marital affair with an HIV positive man. The man, as stated on the note, hence believed that his wife had infected him with the disease; this is being treated by police as the motive of the murder.
