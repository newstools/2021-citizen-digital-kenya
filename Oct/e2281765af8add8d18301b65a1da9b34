A funeral service of a woman in Kapmeswon village in Sotik, Bomet County was on Thursday cut short after a swarm of bees attacked mourners. Three family members were seriously injured and rushed to Kaplong Mission Hospital with other mourners nursing minor injuries. The family was forced to return the woman’s body to the morgue and reschedule burial plans to fit the Kipsigis tradition.
