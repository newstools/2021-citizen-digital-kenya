A 48-year-old man has left the residents of Rwathia village in Gichugu in shock after digging his own grave before killing himself. According to his brother Elias Murimi, the deceased, Joel Muthike also set his house on fire, and stood guard with a sharp panga, preventing anyone from putting out the fire. “Hatujui ni nini, hakusema kama kuna kitu imemkasirisha ama kama ako na shida yoyote,” his brother Murimi told Citizen Digital. “Aliniambia anataka kujinyonga na wakati nilijaribu kusaidia, akanikimbisha na panga,” According to reports, the deceased, after ensuring that his house had been razed to the ground, went missing, only to be found some three hours later, dangling from a mango tree in his neighbour’s farm. Residents said they had reported the matter to the nearby Mucagara police station after the deceased set his house ablaze. Gichugu Sub-county police commander Anthony Mbogo has confirmed the Thursday evening incident, saying  police have launched investigations. The body of the deceased was removed to the Kibugi Funeral Home awaiting a postmortem. Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
