The government has disbursed Ksh. 17.5 billion for the second term of primary and secondary schools, according to Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha. Primary schools will receive Ksh.2.2 billion, while secondary schools will receive Ksh.15.5 billion ahead of the re-opening of the schools next week. According to CS Magoha, schools will not have any reason to turn learners away when they re-open. Meanwhile, more than 20,000 classrooms are being constructed to ensure a smooth transition from primary to junior secondary school under the competency-based curriculum (CBC). The classes for Grade 7 will be ready for use in 2023, according to the Education Ministry’s boss, and will cost Ksh.16B to build.
