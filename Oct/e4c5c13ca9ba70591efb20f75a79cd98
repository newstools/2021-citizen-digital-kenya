The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) is accusing the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) of interfering with the functions of the Director Public Prosecutions (DPP) in the Tob Cohen’s case. “The tussle between the heads of the two offices over the power of initiation of criminal charges has spiraled out of control,” reads the press statement. Through its president Nelson Havi, the society says that the DCI is determined to arrest justice Sankale Ole Kantai and arraign him. “The DCI has in this case purported to arrogate to himself powers that he does not have, by demanding that the judge be charged when the DPP has determined on the basis of evidence and the law…,” says LSK. Last month, senior assistant Inspector General of Police John Gachomo based at DCI accused the DPP of declining to charge Court of Appeal judge  Sankale ole Kantai claiming that the judge actively participated in the planning and cover up of the murder of Tob Cohen. The office of DCI accused DPP agents and officers of trying to illegally and unconstitutionally trying to terminate investigation and further charging the judge. Also Read: “The DPP can only terminate criminal proceedings instituted by his office and not criminal investigations being undertaken by DCI while exercising it’s constitutional mandate…,” reads court papers. Further they argue that the DPP has never communicated to the DCI indicating what evidence was missing in the investigation file that was forwarded to them for the judge to be prosecuted. A petition has also been filed before the Public Service Commision seeking the removal of the DPP. Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
