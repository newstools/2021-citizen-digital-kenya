IEBC has decried a low turnout in its Enhanced Voter Registration exercise, with only 202,518 new voters registering out of the weekly national target of 1,500,000 — representing 13.5% of the National week target. The Commission, which targets to register 6 million new eligible voters says, Samburu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Wajir, West Pokot, Mandera, Nandi, Baringo, Narok, Turkana and Tana River Counties recorded the highest percentage of targets. Meanwhile, Mombasa, Nairobi, Kirinyaga, Embu, Laikipia, Muranga, Kitui, Nyandarua, Nyeri and Kiambu recorded the lowest percentage of targets in the last 7 days. IEBC attributed the low numbers to voter apathy, insecurity in Lamu, Baringo and Laikipia Counties as well as along Kenya-Somalia
borders, lack of ID Cards and the culture of last-minute rush. On voter transfers, a total of 5,206 requests were serviced by the Commission. The Commission launched the Enhanced Voter Registration (ECVR) exercise on 4th October 2021
that is to run for 30 days. Also Read: The Commission has deployed the Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) system with a total of
