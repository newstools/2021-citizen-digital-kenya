A city trader accused of attempting to kill Ranalo Foods restaurant owner William Osewe by shooting him in 2016 has been sentenced to 23 years in jail. Tom Mboya, who is a tour operator, was sentenced by Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku on Wednesday after considering the probation report tabled in court. “I have considered the probation report tabled before me and noted that the accused, Tom Mboya, never showed any remorse of his offence,” ruled the magistrate. The court also considered the impact of the offence on the victim, Mr. Osewe, who was and still is adversely affected by the act. The hotelier was represented by lawyer William Ongoro. “I sentence the accused to 20 years in jail for attempted murder charge and three years for wounding,” ruled Magistrate Mutuku. Last week, the court found Mboya guilty of the offence after the prosecution proved its case beyond doubt that he committed the offence. Also Read: “I have considered the evidence before court and it is undisputed that Mboya shot Osewe,” added the magistrate. Mboya is said to have shot Mr. Osewe multiple times in December 2016 at Garden Estate in Kasarani following an argument over Stella Mutheu, a woman believed to be the latter’s wife. Mr. Osewe was admitted at the Aga Khan Hospital’s High Dependency Unit (HDU) where he underwent surgeries to remove the bullets. Mboya surrendered himself to Kasarani Police Station, after which he was arraigned in court where he pleaded not guilty in 2017 and was released on a cash bail of Ksh.300,000.
