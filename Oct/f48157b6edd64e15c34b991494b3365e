Leaders Real Madrid lost their first game in La Liga this season as they were beaten 2-1 at Espanyol. Raul de Tomas gave the hosts a 17th-minute lead when he met Adrian Embarba’s low cross into the box. Aleix Vidal added an excellent second, beating Nacho before firing past Thibaut Courtois on the hour mark. Karim Benzema responded for Real with a fine finish into the bottom corner with 19 minutes left, but Carlo Ancelotti’s side could not find a late equaliser. It is a second loss in a week for Real, who suffered a shock Champions League defeat by competition debutants Sheriff Tiraspol on Tuesday. Ancelotti’s side are now winless in three games after being held to a goalless draw against Villarreal in their previous league outing.
