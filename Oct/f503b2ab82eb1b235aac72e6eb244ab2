Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has been told to brace for a bruising battle in the race for the Alego Usonga parliamentary seat in the 2022 General Elections. This comes after Governor Rasanga recently declared interest in the Alego Usonga parliamentary seat after his tenure as the county boss comes to completion next year. Current Member of Parliament Samuel Atandi welcomed him into the race, however warning him to prepare for stiff competition. Mr. Atandi, while dismissing the recent reports that there is already an existing line-up of ODM party’s preferred candidates in Siaya County, told Rasanga that he is going to beat him pants down in the race. He made the remarks on Saturday during a fundraising at Agoro Oyombe Primary School where Siaya Senator James Orengo endorsed him for a second term citing exemplary performance in Parliament and good development track record. Mr. Orengo, who had earlier been endorsed for the Siaya gubernatorial seat by Governor Rasanga, stated that no one can destroy his friendship with Mr. Atandi, equally dismissing rumors about the line-up of preferred candidates. Also Read: His sentiments were echoed by Rarieda MP Otiende Amolo and his Gem counterpart Elisha Odhiambo who assured the people of Alego Usonga that ODM is a democratic party that cannot allow such imaginary line-ups. They ruled out rumors that some people are going to be given direct tickets and assured them that ODM will conduct free and fair nominations to ensure that he or she who wins in the party primaries is the one who shall be given the ticket.
