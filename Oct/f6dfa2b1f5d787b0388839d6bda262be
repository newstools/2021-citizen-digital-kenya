Kisumu Lady Bucks head coach Michael Dave expects to break the jinx of a winless run in the league on Sunday, when they take on Strathmore University at home. Bucks who are new in the league are last with only three points but Dave believes Strathmore have lost their last season’s quality, and are thus beatable. “We are looking to win the match having in mind we haven’t won any since the league started which has been basically due to poor preparations. Strathmore has lost a number of players and they are not the same force they were last season.  We expect a bigger challenge because they have been training together but we can get a result,” Dave said. On their side Strathmore are in the eighth position with 12 points after playing nine games, winning three and losing six. Meanwhile Storms head coach Abel Nson is disappointed with last minute changes of the league fixtures, leaving him with little time to adjust tactically. Storms were to play Equity on Saturday and Zetech on Sunday, before the changes that will see them collide with KPA on Sunday, while Saturday’s match has been postponed Also Read: “We shall take it like any other game, all along we were preparing for Zetech but as things are we will have to be careful with the approach we employ after the change of plan. We are looking forward for a win, but we may not adjust much given the remaining time,” Nson said. In other fixtures of the women basketball premier league on Saturday, Eagle Wings will play Zetech from 8:30am before KU Oryx takes on KPA at 10:00am at the Nyayo Stadium Gymnasium. UON Dynamites will then entertain ANU at 11:30am in the same venue, putting a pause until Sunday when Oryx will take on ANU before Storms and KPA’s match at 10:00am and 11:30am respectively.
