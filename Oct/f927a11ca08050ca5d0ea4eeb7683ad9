An armed robber was on Tuesday beaten to death by a mob in Ruai in after a botched robbery, police say. According to a police report seen by Citizen Digital, two women who were headed to work in the wee hours of Tuesday were attacked by three gun-totting thieves near the Capitol Hill in Ruai. “The thugs, who were having a field day robbing unsuspecting pedestrians, had just accosted the two Anne Wanjiru and Lilian Mueni, when the unthinkable happened,” the police said. Seargent Samuel Mutuku, a police officer on his way to work, witnessed the robbery and sprung into action, ordering the trio to surrender. “The miscreants defied the order and turned back to attack him. But the experienced sergeant with a distinguished career in protection of life and property was too smart for their antics. He opened fire, seriously injuring one of them as the others took flight,” the police report adds. The officer then pursued the two remaining suspects, who had taken to their heels before attempting to hop on a nearby motorbike. The bike failed to start, forcing the three to flee on foot, according to officers familiar with the situation. Meanwhile, one of the shot suspects was surrounded by a mob, who proceeded to give him a brutal beating, killing him on the spot. The officer’s pleas to have the suspect face his fate in a court of law, according to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), fell on deaf ears. A getaway motorbike of registration KMFL 494T, was impounded as detectives dig more details into the identity of the suspects. A mobile phone that had been snatched from one of the victims was recovered from the suspect as well as  a long sword and a machete.
