A 32-year-old man in Kipreres area, Bomet County, killed his wife by slitting her throat and later took poison in an attempt to take his own life following a domestic quarrel. Area Chief Robert Kataam said the body of the deceased was found some meters from their homestead, intimating that the 25-year-old may have been murdered elsewhere and the body moved. Angry villagers then stormed the couple’s house and found the suspect, Nickson Sang, writhing in pain after consuming poison. Elders and members of the Nyumba Kumi restrained the irate mob from attacking the suspect and took him to Longisa referral hospital where he is presently undergoing medication. According to the administrator, the couple had been quarreling over a loan they reportedly borrowed from a lender at Mulot trading center. The body of the deceased  has since been moved to the Longisa mortuary. Also Read: Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
