Robson Chinhoi of Zimbabwe overcame stiff resistance from close challengers by producing a two under par 70 in the final round of the second leg in the Kenya Open Golf Limited owned Safari Tour’s Season Four at the par 72 Vet Lab Sports Club course to emerge victorious. Besides the 50 points towards the Order of Merit, and the winner’s trophy, Chinhoi who last season won three events in the tour, became Sh308,293 richer, which included Ksh 230,000 prize money and the payout from the bonus pool for finishing with a score better than -3. A total of 10 players registered sub-par rounds throughout the week and were rewarded from the Ksh 400,000 bonus pool. Chinhoi bogeyed the second and third holes after making the first birdie at the par five-fifth hole and added one more at the par three-eighth to level the nine enroute to the back nine where he birdied the 12th and 15th for the day’s two under par and a tournament aggregate of five under 283 winning by two shots from Sigona’s Mohit Mediratta, home pro Mike Kisia and round two leader Greg Snow. Mediratta closed the tournament with a fine four under par 68, a round that included six birdies and a bogey in each nine, for an aggregate of three under par 285 to tie at second place with Kisia and Snow. Now all action heads for the third round at the Great Rift Valley Golf Resort in Naivasha this coming weekend after the opening leg at Sigona and the Vet Lab rounds. At Kabete the tournament attracted a field of 64 players though only 24 made the second round cut, to proceed to the last two rounds.
