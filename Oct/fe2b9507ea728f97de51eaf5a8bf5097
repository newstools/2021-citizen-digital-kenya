Gor Mahia head coach Mark Harrison has told his players that they must earn their places in the team and that no one would be an automatic starter. Speaking in Murangá after a 1-0 victory over Muranga seals FC in a friendly match dubbed ‘handshake derby’, played Sunday at St. Sebastian Park in Kiharu Constituency, Harrison said the quality of players they recruited is good and everyone will have to fight for a slot. “The quality of the eight players we recruited is so good and so there will be no guarantee for a first eleven slot for any player. They will have to work hard to show they deserve to play in any game,’’ said Harrison. The coach said they are aiming at retaining the FKF Cup as well as reclaiming the league title they lost to Tusker last season. According to the former Botswana’s Township Rollers coach, the composition of the team is almost complete. KÓgalo kicked off the season on a high note last weekend when they beat last season’s runners-up KCB 2-1 at Thika Sub-County with both strikes coming from returning youthful striker Benson Omalla. In the meantime, Harrison has lamented the loss of quality players who were in the camp last season but is still optimistic the new outfit will be equal to the task Also Read: “You know we lost many good players and this slowed down the pace of the team, but I can assure you the new outfit will send a new message to the Kenyan football. It is all about taking everything seriously if we have to reach the level we want.’’ Last week, Harrison said his players had not achieved his target level though he admits they are on the right track. They play their first CAF Confederations Cup match against Al-Ahly of Sudan on October 16 in Khartoum and Harrison is confident his boys will make a mark this time around having fallen to north African teams in the preliminary stages of the competition in the past.
