Bunyore Starlets management is planning to beef up its playing unit ahead of the 2021/22 FKF-Women Premier League season by signing 12 new players. The Vihiga-based side was recently promoted to the women’s top tier side after emerging winners of the FKF Division One Zone B league with 40 points, and the club’s leadership is leaving nothing to chance in the recruitment drive. Speaking to Citizen Digital, team head coach Daniel Arunga said they will strengthen the squad by adhering to the FKF requirements of at least 30 players per team. “Currently we have a squad of 18 players and we need 12 more to attain the FKF requirements. I will focus on all the departments because the league we’re going to play is very competitive and we we’ve to prepare well to face the league,” said Arunga. The coach however raised an early red flag on financial constraints which he said could be the biggest challenge ahead of the new campaign. “We have a big problem with sponsorship. Currently, we get aid from the county government and I’m calling on the well-wishers to join hands with us as we start our new life in the top league” he added.
