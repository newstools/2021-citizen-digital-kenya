Unga Group Plc has seen its full-year profit to June 2021 grow by three-fold to Ksh.293.5 million from Ksh.66.2 million at the same stage last year. The remarkable growth in earnings for the processing firm is largely anchored on a 24.8 per cent decline in finance costs to Ksh.150.6 million following a restructure of its bank facilities. At the same time, Unga received payment for grain supplied in support of the government-led subsidy program in 2017. “The interest element of the debt remains outstanding. The long outstanding tax refunds were also received during the year ending a protracted litigation process. Both receipts improved profit for the year,” the company stated on Wednesday. Unga turnover in the period remained largely unchanged at Ksh.17.8 billion from Ksh.17.6 billion in 2020. The lower finance costs and steady revenue helped offset rising import/input costs and FX losses from the depreciation of the Kenyan shilling in the period.

The company nevertheless expects its recent joint ventures to set the firm on a growth trajectory. “More value-add partnership opportunities will be pursued while advancing automation opportunities in the base business,” the company added. At the end of the financial year, Unga entered agreements with Nutreco BV to form two joint ventures which will expand its aqua-feed business. Further, Unga entered an agreement to sell its Ensvalley Bakery assets to Big Cold Kenya Limited. Both transactions are expected to close by December 31. The board of Unga has not recommended the payment of a final dividend for the period. Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
