Homicide detectives drawn from the DCI headquarters have concluded the re-enactment of four murder scenes where self-confessed serial killer Masten Milimo led them in Bungoma county. Friday’s exercise bringing to 13 the number of minors who lost their lives in the hands of 20-year-old Masten Wanjala who lured his victims under the guise of being a football coach. Homicide detectives started around a culvert at Bwema area in Kanduyi Bungoma County, the latest scene where Masten Wanjala the self-confessed serial killer led them. Villagers were in dismay as they watched the detective Martin Nyuguto-led team draped in white in action. The 20-year-old suspect who was among the officers pointed out that was where he hid the body of a 9-year-old he strangled in February 2019. With no body found, detectives collected samples of what struck as human remains to be taken through DNA identification. Area residents expressed shock, some counting themselves lucky as they sometimes saw Wanjala spending time with their children. “Amekuwa akikunjanga hapa kuwafunza mambo ya mpira, kumbe atakuja kupa na kutupa kwa kijiji yangu,” a local told Citizen TV. Detectives have confirmed that Wanjala killed four minors in Bungoma, bringing to 13, the number of his victims. The 20-year-old led detectives to two murder scenes in Machakos county, five in Nairobi and two in Kajiado. He is expected in court next week where he will face 13 counts of murder.
