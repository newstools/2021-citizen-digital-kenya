The Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) has suspended 14 brands of hand sanitizers for failing to meet quality requirements following a recently conducted surveillance. KEBS, in a statement to newsrooms on Wednesday, said 47 sanitizer brands were collected and assessed against the Standards Act in the surveillance. The State agency said 33 of them, representing 70% of the brands, met the requirements while the 14 failed. “The manufacturers in the list are instructed to recall all affected hand sanitizer brands batches from the market. In addition, it is the responsibility of the manufacturers to verify with KEBS that the other batches are compliant,” read the statement. “They are to institute effective corrective actions whose effectiveness shall be confirmed by KEBS before resumption of production and placement of the brands in the market.” KEBS further stated: “This is not a ban of the hand sanitizer brands but a temporary suspension until the products comply with the Kenya Standard.” Also Read: The 14 non-compliant hand sanitizer brands and their manufacturers are:  Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
