Kenya Rugby Sevens head coach Innocent ‘Namcos’ Simiyu says they’ll polish the grey areas ahead of Edmonton Sevens set for this weekend in Canada. Kenya had an impressive run at the Vancouver Sevens but fell at the last hurdle losing 38-5 to eventual champions South Africa and Simiyu says they’ll have to improve on their kicks and transition between attack and defense. “There are a few areas of concern in the team and we’re currently working on them ahead of our next assignment here in Canada,” said Simiyu. “We also have to work on our execution while playing under pressure and when playing stronger opponents,” he added. Simiyu at the same time praised debutants Levy Amunga, Derick Keyoga, Timothy Mmasi and Alvin Marube after they all scored their first tries for Shujaa in the circuit. “Our boys played very well, especially the new guys who were quite excited with how they expressed themselves being their first tournament with the national team,” said Simiyu.
