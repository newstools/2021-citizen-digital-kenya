The CAF Women Champions League CECAFA qualifiers’ MVP Jentrix Shikangwa admits her breakout performance has brought heightened attention on her from several clubs but her dream is to play for FA Women’s Super League champions, Chelsea Women. Shikangwa played a starring role as Vihiga Queens defeated CBE 2-1 in the final on Thursday, with her brace that included a last-minute penalty propeling the Kenyans to the inaugural CAF Women’s Champions League set for November in Cairo, Egypt. “A number of teams have expressed their interest but if I get the opportunity I would love to play in England for Chelsea Women,” Shikangwa told Citizen Digital. Fresh from Wiyeta Girls Secondary School, the 19-year-old forward is among three players targeted by Simba Queens, whom they beat in the semi-final. Violet Wanyonyi and Terry Engesha are the other two. Recounting the winning penalty which she converted expertly, Shikangwa said she was never nervous on the spot. “I felt good when I scored the penalty. I believe in myself. It’s something normal to me to take penalties and score,” she said.
