AFC Leopards former central defender Robinson Kamura has revealed that he made an easy and quick move to join the FKF-PL last season first runners up KCB because of Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno phone call. Kamura whose is yet to be unveiled by his new employees with his contract details yet to be disclosed at least for now, is happy for joining a team coached by Otieno who he say they knew each other while still at Mathare United youth team U-19 “Coach knows me very well since I was a young boy at Mathare (United) U-19. Zico knows me and knows my quality. ” That is why it was easy for me to make that decision of joining KCB when he came calling because he is the one who called me on phone and we had a talk. I did not even have to think twice before accepting his offer,” Kamura revealed. According to Kamura, he needed a place where he will be assured of game time and feel appreciated after falling out of favour with Leopards technical bench last season resulting in him being stripped of the captaincy. “To settle for KCB is because they are a good side, they performed very well last season despite missing out to champions Tusker by a whisker to clinch the league title.

Through AFC, I am somewhere in terms of my career and I am sure what they have done for me may be other teams could not have managed to do that as far as nurturing my talent and building my career,” Kamura concluded.
