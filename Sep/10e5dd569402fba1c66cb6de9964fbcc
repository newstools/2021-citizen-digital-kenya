Kenya has received the second batch of 210,000 doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines from the U.S government to boost the vaccination exercise. The vaccines arrived at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) around 1am on Tuesday from the COVAX facility. This comes after the country on September 17, 2021 received 795,600 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Another batch of doses of the vaccine is due to arrive in the country in the coming weeks to complete the 2.03 million Pfizer vaccine doses the U.S government pledged to donate to Kenya. U.S President Joe Biden previously committed to deliver over a billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to countries across the world. The World Health Organisation has so far approved six COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use, including all four now available in Kenya – AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer.
