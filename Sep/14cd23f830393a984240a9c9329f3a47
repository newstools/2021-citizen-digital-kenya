A 35-year-old woman was lynched by irate members of the public in Bondo, Siaya County after she was accused of being behind the theft of some 21 chicken at Onyata ‘B’ village in Bar-Kowino sub-location. The woman identified as Eunice Akoth was allegedly caught carrying one of the hens which had been stolen last night, before the angry villagers began beating her after she failed to explain where she had gotten the chicken. According to the Assistant Chief of Bar-Kowino sub-location Mr. Edwin Olima, the woman together with accomplices who were not identified, broke through the wall of a house where the poultry were kept before walking away with 21 of them. He stated that the suspect who was burnt beyond recognition completely refused to disclose her accomplices and that is what angered the members of public who after beating her senselessly, decided to set her body ablaze. The Assistant Chief, however, noted that though it is wrong for anyone to steal, it was also not in order for members of the public to take the law into their hands. The remains of the woman were moved to Bondo Sub-county Hospital mortuary as investigations into the matter continue.
