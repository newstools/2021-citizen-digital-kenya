Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has moved to second position on the log after defeating visitors Zetech University 57-43 in the women’s premier league played at Makande Gymnasium in Mombasa. In an entertaining and tough match that could have gone either way, we saw Dockers struggle in the second and third quarters but thanks to their huge win in the first quarter made things difficult for the students. KPA started on a high note winning the first quarter 18-06 before losing 11-16 and 12-14 in the second and third quarters consecutively.
In the last quarter, the former champions used their experience well as they registered a 16-07 win to bag the victory. KPA have now moved to second position on the log with 15 points after eight games replacing Zetech who are third with 15 points too after nine matches.
KPA head coach Anthony Ojukwu attributed the win to experience adding that it was a good match. “The game was tough, our opponents gave us a good show but I am happy for my players they were tough mentally, physically and showed what they are made of,” Ojukwu said. KPA missed three key players who are with the national team in Cameron for Afrobasket and Ojukwu had this to say: “My players showed their abilities and strength and that they can perform even in the hardest situation and doesn’t depend on anyone to win,” he added.
