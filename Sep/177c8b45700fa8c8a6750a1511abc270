The national women’s basketball team head coach George Mayienga says the omission of Felmas Adhiambo Koranga from the squad was because she was unavailable for selection due to study reasons. US-based Koranga’s name was conspicuously missing from the squad that was named yesterday to take part at the 2021 FIBA Afrobasket Championship in Cameroon. She was instrumental for the Lionesses in the qualifiers that were held in Kigali, Rwanda in July, earning selection among the best five alongside compatriot Victoria Reynolds. Her place has been filled by Ivy Opicho who plays for the women’s premier league side Strathmore but Mayienga acknowledges that her absence is a big blow to them. “It is something to do with her studies in college the USA where she is studying. It’s a tall order for us because if you look at the semis and the final of the qualifiers I used her more and she did her job very well. I believe the player that will take or play in her place will give her best,” Mayienga said. The experienced tactician says that they will take one game at a time even though they are worried about the host nation whom they are pooled together in Group A alongside Cape Verde.
