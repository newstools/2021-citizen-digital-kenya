Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria now says he will not be seeking any elective seat in 2022 The vocal MP who is also the Chama cha Kazi party leader says his primary role will now be uniting the Mt Kenya leadership. He will also negotiate the region’s best deal with presidential candidates who are jostling for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s succession. “Mwaka ujao hakuna kiti mimi nitasimama, kazi yangu ni kuunda chama itakayo leta MCAs, Governors and MPs from the region pamoja,” Kuria said on Tuesday. The MP said the vote-rich region must be included in all the discussions and welcomed at the table where the future of the country will be discussed. “I want to tell everyone that we must be at the table where all the food will be served, if they don’t include, we will hang on the table until we all eat from the floor,” Kuria added. At the same time, MP Kuria said that there is no single candidate who is assured of Mt. Kenya region’s votes. Kuria, the Service Party Leader Mwangi Kiunjuri and NARC Kenya boss Martha Karua have initiated a Mt. Kenya political parties unity, after they declined to fold up their vehicles and join the United Democratic Alliance(UDA) that is fronting deputy president William Ruto as its flagbearer in next year’s presidential race.
