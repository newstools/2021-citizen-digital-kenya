National Sevens Team, Shujaa, are through to the semifinals of the Edmonton Sevens after edging Germany 24-17 in their semifinal played on Sunday 26 September 2021. Jeff Oluoch’s try gave Innocent Simiyu’s men the lead, as Levi Amunga converted for a 7-0 mark just after the start. Oluoch landed his brace, Amunga making no mistake in his conversion to extend Kenya’s score to 14-0, in what was hitherto a one sided affair. Alvin Otieno scored at the stroke of half time, Shujaa taking a 19-0 lead into the break. But the Germans resumed with such a determination, and responded with a try from Carlos Merz, Fabian Hempel converting to bring the score to 19-7. Otieno was the man of the moment as Kenya responded almost immediately, grabbing his brace to the tally to 24-7.
