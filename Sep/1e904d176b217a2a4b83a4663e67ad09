A 30-year-old man has succumbed to injuries sustained during a bar fight with his friend over an argument over a job placement in Uasin Gishu County. According to a police report seen by Citizen Digital, Peter Ekai (30) and Elphas Kipkoech (26) were on a drinking spree at Longisa trading centre in Kamagut when an argument ensued. Ekai is said to have accused Kipkoech of plotting to have him fired from ChapChap security agency where he (Ekai) worked as a guard. Ekai is said to have been convinced that Kipkoech was orchestrating his downfall so as to replace him at the security agency. Kipkoech however denied the allegations and the war of words turned into a full-blown bar brawl as the two, reportedly already drunk by then, started attacking each other using sharp objects. Ekai was stabbed on the chest and succumbed to his injuries at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital where he had been rushed for treatment.
