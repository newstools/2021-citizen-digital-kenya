Gor Mahia head coach Mark Harrison says his team will fight to regain the league title from rivals Tusker FC when the campaign resumes this weekend. The 19-time Kenyan champions finished eighth last season with the brewers winning their 12th title and Harrison believes despite the departure of some key players and the financial challenges the club is facing the players are ready to deliver trophies. “The pandemic has brought many challenges to not only Gor but to many teams across the world but are determined to give our best and regain the title we lost to Tusker last season, that’s our main aim locally. “We are also determined to go past the group stages in our continental assignment. We know we will face tough opponents but we know our strengthen as a team, “he explained. “We will want to capitalize on that and make Kenyans proud.” Gor will clash with Tusker FC in the FKF Super Cup on Wednesday at the Nyayo National Stadium before opening their league campaign against KCB on Saturday and the coach is expecting his side to kick off the campaign on a high with more leadership from his vice captain Philemon Otieno who was named the August fans player of the month. “He is a key member of our squad and he has shown the leadership and hard work in training, on the pitch and off the pitch. We are looking forward to seeing more of that from him when the season begins,” added the tactician.
