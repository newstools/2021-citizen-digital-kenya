Nine prisoners who escaped from Nanyuki GK Prison on Saturday, and who have since been arrested will serve a two year sentence for the offence. The nine who escaped from the highly guarded prison on Saturday were all in remand awaiting the conclusion of their cases. One of the prisoners, Francis Kamau Nduati, who was among six inmates who were still at large was arrested on Sunday in Kirinyaga after members of the public spotted him in the company of another inmate and alerted the police. Police are still in hot pursuit of the five prisoners who escaped during the incident and are still at large. The prison department has also launched investigations into the incident. The Saturday 2am prison break saw 14 inmates break out after cutting metallic grills using a hacksaw and jumping over the fence.
