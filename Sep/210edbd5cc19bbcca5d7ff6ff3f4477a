ODM presidential contender Jimmy Wanjigi has told off naysayers questioning his bid, expressing confidence in the Orange party to exercise democracy while selecting its flag-bearer in the 2022 race. Speaking in Kisumu on Thursday, Wanjigi repeated ODM chairman Wycliffe Oparanya’s stance on fairness in party primaries and certifying popular candidates who would square off during nominations. The billionaire is on a four-day trip of Nyanza, visiting Homabay, Migori, Siaya, and Kisumu counties to promote ODM and his presidential bid. The ODM branch in Kisumu, on the other hand, has distanced itself from the visit, urging ODM members to boycott Wanjigi’s tour. Wanjigi protested the remarks, saying that as an ODM life member, he had the right to tour any area of the country in order to popularize the party. He said that he is a strong representative of the ODM leader leader- Raila Odinga- saying that what is ion display now is a healthy competition and a show of democracy.
