A Form Two student at Naburereya Secondary School in Bungoma County committed suicide on Monday after her parents reprimanded her for refusing to report back to school. Joan Wekesa, 21, hanged herself at her boyfriend’s rented house at Kabula market. The mother had visited the market where the girl had spent the previous night and reprimanded her, demanding that she goes back to school. “I was told by a neighbor that Joan had spent a night with a man who works at a local concrete making company but when I came and questioned her she looked at me and kept quiet,” she said. The mother says she left her daughter and went back home and informed her father but when they came back her lifeless body was dangling on a rope inside the house. According to the mother, the girl had abruptly refused to go to school and threatened to commit suicide if they continue pestering her.
