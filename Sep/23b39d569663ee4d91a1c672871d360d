AFC Leopards will decide whether to sign a new goalkeeper to cover up the spot left by Ugandan Benjamin Ochan who has departed the club following the expiration of his contract. Ochan, who was Leopards’ first choice goalkeeper, has already moved after signing with Ugandan giants KCCA with assistant coach Tom Juma wishing him all the best in his new challenge. “We can’t play without a competitive goalkeeping department and so that may force us to look for other options. It was his personal decision and that is what football is all about. He made a choice to return to his home country and that is what has happened but the club must continue with life without him,” Juma revealed. Ochan’s departure has left Ingwe with only two goalkeepers – Ezekiel Owade and Maxwell Mulili – but Juma has stressed that a new goalie won’t be a desperate need. The 31-year-old has been a permanent fixture in the Leopards squad under head coach Patrick Aussems and is the second goalkeeper to leave after John Oyemba whose contract has also expired. Leopards, who finished fourth behind champions Tusker, KCB and Bandari in the last season of the FKF Premier League, has seen some of its key players including Elvis Rupia, Collins Shichenje, Clyde Senaji, Harrison Mwendwa, Jafferi Owiti depart the club.
