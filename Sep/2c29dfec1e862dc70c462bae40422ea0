Rotax Junior Max leader Kris Bhanderi says the penultimate leg of the Kenya National Karting Championship in Nakuru could be the biggest moment of his racing career. Bhanderi, 15, will be going for his maiden career karting title at the Rift Valley Motor Sports Club’s Solai racetrack which plays host to the season-closing double-header (round 9th and 10th) on Saturday and Sunday. Bhanderi will be looking to eclipse round 7 winner William Kim and second-placed Myles Imbayi prior to major celebrations in Nakuru County. “I am aiming for my eighth victory on Solai asphalt this weekend and if I achieve that, I could have the title in the bag. This means my participation in Round 10 may as well be a mere formality,” said Bhanderi. Having already taken some impressive scalps at Whistling Morans racetrack, Bhanderi is leaving nothing to chance in the fresh Rift Valley challenge. “I practice twice a month at the Whistling Moran racetrack. I also work on my fitness with my personal trainer twice a week to ensure I am in the best possible shape. Fitness makes me energetic to handle the kart better and so, fingers crossed,” Bhanderi added. Also Read: “The essence is to drive a safe race. So I will not be taking unnecessary risks. If the championship plan doesn’t work out in Round 9, I will go for it in round 10. It will all depend on the situation at the weekend race meeting,” he revealed. He added: “William Kim will be a tough nut to crack as always. Myles is lying second in the championship but there is a three- year experience difference between us being his first season in Rotax Junior Max.” The double-header is also expected to feature Cadet Comer Class leader Walt Alobo and his opponents Ethan Gitonga, Wandel Olendo and Charles Kahumbura.   Alobo leads the Cadet Comer log with 709points followed by Gitonga on 700 and Olendo on 577.
