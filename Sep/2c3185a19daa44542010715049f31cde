Five accused persons in the murder of lawyer Willie Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri have been put on their defence after a Nairobi court ruled that they have a case to answer. Lady Justice Jessie Lessit on Monday ruled that the prosecution has established a case against the five, among them four police officers and a civilian. “I have considered the entire evidence and having done so I have come to the conclusion that the prosecution has established a prima facie case,” ruled Justice Lesit. The five will now defend themselves and present their witnesses before a final verdict is delivered. Lawyer Willie Kimani was murdered in 2016 together with his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri in what sparked outrage in the legal fraternity. The murder case has dragged in court taking a slow dive over the past two years.

Since 2016, 46 prosecution witnesses have taken to the stand, detailing the events that led to the deaths of the three and the ultimate dumping of their bodies in a river at Oldonyo Sabuk until their decomposing bodies were recovered one week after their disappearance.
