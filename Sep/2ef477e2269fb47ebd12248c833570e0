Cristiano Ronaldo on Wednesday vowed to help Manchester United win major trophies again, calling his return to the club “the best decision” and the beginning of a new chapter. The Portugal forward sealed a move back to United, where he previously spent six seasons between 2003-09 and won eight major honours, from Juventus this week on a two-year deal with the option of an additional year. “I think it’s the best decision that I have made. It’s right on point in my opinion… I want to carry on again, to make history, to try to help Manchester achieve great results, to win trophies and number one of them, to win great things,” the 36-year-old told the club website. Ronaldo said that Alex Ferguson, the former United manager who first signed him as an 18-year-old from Sporting Lisbon in 2003, played a big role in the player coming back to Old Trafford. “… Sir Alex Ferguson is like a father in football for me. He helped me a lot, he taught me many things, and in my opinion of course he had a big role because the relationship that we had, we keep in touch all the time, and he’s an unbelievable person,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said. Ronaldo hailed his relationship with current United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who he played alongside for four seasons at the club.
