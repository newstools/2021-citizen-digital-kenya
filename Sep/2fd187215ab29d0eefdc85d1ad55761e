Jentrix Shikangwa converted a last-gasp penalty to power Vihiga Queens to a 2-1 victory over Ethiopia’s Commercial Bank as the Kenyans won the Cecafa Women Club Championships title at the Kasarani Stadium on Thursday. Victory also saw the former Kenyan champions secure the region’s sole ticket for the inaugural CAF Women’s Champions League due to be held in November in Cairo, Egypt. Shikangwa set Vihiga off the mark in the 27th minute when she bundled home a loose ball which goalkeeper Trikua Balcha had failed to deal with but the honours were evened just minutes into the second half after Vivian Makokha headed the ball into her own net. That set up a frenetic final half hour in which Vihiga struck the post thrice and it all came down to the brilliant Shikangwa to settle the tie from the penalty spot after Violet Wanyonyi was hacked inside the area. The 19-year-old stepped up and planted it coolly into the roof of Balcha’s post to send into delirium a home side that had watched in frustration as chance after chance went begging. She was chosen the tournament’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) and rightly so. She has been in sparkling form and was the brightest spot at a cracking final.
