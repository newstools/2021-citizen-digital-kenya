Former nominated Senator Paul Njoroge has moved to court seeking to have next year’s General Election moved to 2023. He argues that when IEBC made the declaration that the next general election be held on 9th of August it was improperly constituted as it did not have the requisite proper quorom of its commissioners. The Senator claims that IEBC has embarked and initiated a very costly and ambitious administrative process including tendering of various hardware and software materials for the said elections. The former nominated senator further claims that the ongoing procurement is illegal and irregular. “The intended presidential election of 9th August is imposed to the people of Kenya through an administrative fiat of the IEBC and therefore illegal, irregular and illegitimate,” reads court papers. He further argues that the 2022 General Election has a direct and adverse bearing and/or impact on Country’s public finances and on the other levels of governance including the County Governments and therefore the 3rd, 4th and 5th Interested Parties are enjoined to enforce their respective supervisory powers over the affairs of the commission.
