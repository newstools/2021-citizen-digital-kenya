Police have arrested four prime suspects linked to the gruesome murder of a national government administration officer in Mt Elgon, Bungoma County. 57-year-old Geoffrey Kipsang, the Chepyuk Location Chief, was found murdered and his body buried in a shallow grave on Friday last week in a maize plantation about three kilometers from his homestead. Following his death, irate residents stormed a local illicit brew den and torched houses that they suspected harbored the people who might have killed him. The locals also burned several houses that were around the place where his body was found. The four suspects including two men and two women are believed to have cooperated with others who police are still pursuing. Residents also killed one suspect who is believed to have hoodwinked the chief into his killing.
