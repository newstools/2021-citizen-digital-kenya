Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) have seized over Ksh.60 million in fake US dollars at a transport logistics facility on Lusaka Road in Industrial Area, Nairobi. According to the DCI, the fake money was set to be shipped to Oman’s port capital of Muscat in the Middle East by a money laundering syndicate under investigation. The 460 US dollar notes in denominations of 100 were packaged in 12 bundles and were declared as marketing flyers for a non-existing African Global Food Supplies, said the DCI. “Acting on a report from Express Kenya security manager, police rushed to the transport logistics facility located at Lusaka Rd within Industrial Area, seizing the consignment bound to Muscat International Hotel in Oman,” added the DCI. Preliminary investigations by the detectives established that the money was being sent to the Middle East by one Belmont Joseph, who is a member of a larger suspected criminal syndicate operating from Kajiado’s Ngong area. Meanwhile, the DCI has sought Interpol’s intervention to facilitate the arrest of the Oman-based consignee – Hamood Abdullah Hamood – as manhunt for the local suspect and his gang intensifies.
