Nairobi City Stars are in the market to find replacements for four players that left the outfit following the conclusion of the 2020/21 season. Left-back Wesley Onguso and attacking midfielder Azizi Okaka are the latest to ditch the club with the duo of Bolton Omwenga and Yusuf Lubowa having done so in the past fortnight. Speaking to Citizen Digital, club Chief Executive Officer Patrick Korir thanked the departing duo for their immense contribution towards the outfit’s promotion from the National Super League (NSL) in the 2019/20 season and a successful 2020/21 campaign. “We thank Onguso, Azizi, and Lubowa for the services rendered to the Nairobi City Stars, for their commitment to the club in the ended year that had great challenges of its own.” “I cannot thank Onguso and Okaka enough for all their professionalism and dedication that led the club to promotion back to the top tier after four seasons, and Lubowa who added punch to the squad after that elevation.” Korir revealed they are in the process of securing their replacements, adding that a top-four finish will be on top of their priorities next season.

Our primary objective will be to finish higher than last season and also apply the experience from last season to excel,” he added. Okaka joined the Hope Centre-based side in January 2020 with the NSL in midseason while Onguso joined the team in 2019 and was an instrumental cog in their stellar 2019/20 season in which they sealed a return topflight after a four-year hiatus.
