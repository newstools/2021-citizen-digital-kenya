National Super League (NSL) side Modern Coast Rangers has officially rebranded and changed to Mombasa Elite FC following an addition of another team sponsor. The changes have been confirmed by the team’s Secretary General Ferdinand Ogot saying an unnamed Mombasa Business person has come on board to solve their long-term salary problems, part of the reason for rebranding. Ogot has insisted that the team’s main base will still be in Mombasa refuting rumours that they will relocate to Nairobi following the new development. “We are happy we have on board a new sponsor, everyone knows how much we struggled to stay afloat last season. We therefore have slight changes including the name, but we are still in Mombasa,” he explained. He added that their earlier sponsors will cater for their transport logistics as the new sponsor carries the salaries and allowances burden in the new season. Mombasa Elite are currently in Nairobi where they have pitched camp ahead of the new season where they are playing FKF Premier League sides as they scout for new players.
