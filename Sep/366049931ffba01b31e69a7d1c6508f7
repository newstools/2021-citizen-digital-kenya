Armed with what he alleged to be court orders the former governor invaded the office of the governor and declared he is still the bonafide governor of the county. Mohamud was impeached in May by the county assembly and his ouster was later upheld at the Senate. Since his ouster he has been embroiled in power struggles with the current governor Ahmed Mukhtar. Last month Mohamud made an appearance at the Council of Governor’s meeting convened in Makueni.  Also Read: Video Of The Day: People living with disability call for inclusion in vaccination drive
