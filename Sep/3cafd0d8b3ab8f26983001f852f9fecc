One suspect was on Sunday killed and ten others arrested after they reportedly intercepted and attacked a police convoy in an attempt to free their criminal accomplices who were being held in custody. The police convoy was also escorting a lorry that had been impounded while transporting 400 bags of uncustomed sugar. According to a police report seen by Citizen Digital, the convoy consisting of DCI detectives and CIPU officers attached to the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) was leaving Chwele Police Station for Kisumu when it came under attack. “Over 20 vehicles and an unknown number of motor cycles whose number plates were concealed were used to barricade the road at Makunga shopping centre, with the gang attempting to seize the consignment and free the suspects,” read the report. One of the police officers sustained serious injuries on the chest and limbs during the ensuing melee. Luckily however, a contingent of police officers headed to Chwele provided reinforcement, aiding in thwarting of the attack and arresting of some of the suspects while others managed to flee.
