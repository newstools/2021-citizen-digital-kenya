New Vihiga Bullets head coach Evans Mafuta says he wants eight new players to bolster the squad he found, to match the Premier League competition from experienced teams. Bullets were promoted from the National Super League (NSL) at the end of 2020/21 season this month, and had little time to prepare for the Football Kenya Federation (FKF-PL)  new season which kicked off last week. Another major development in the team saw coach Edward Manoah who guided Bullets into the FKF-PL resign, saying he was retiring. He thus paved way for Mafuta, who had only a week to prepare for their first fixture of the Premier League, which they secured a draw against Bidco United. “The squad isn’t bad at all. I’m in the process of signing players. I need about four to five and utmost eight,” said Mafuta. Mafuta is said to have links with Western based clubs players, as he intends to fix his woes ahead of his top tier fixtures.

Striker Mophat Liuva of Kakamega Homeboyz FC is also among the eight players Mafuta is targeting. His assistant Milton Kidiga has appreciated Mafuta’s impact in the team, considering he is still settling in the team. “Since Mafuta joined us, the boys have improved. Currently, I would urge the boys to go for better results, match after a match without really focusing on the end product at the end of the season,” he noted.
