Tiaty Member of Parliament (MP) William Kamket will spend two more nights in police custody pending a ruling on his bail application. The MP was on Tuesday arraigned before Nakuru Senior Principal Magistrate Lilian Arika and charged with incitement to violence in connection with the skirmishes in Laikipia. He is accused of making inciteful remarks during a meeting held at Amaya area in Tiaty, Laikipia County on July 16, 2021. He pleaded not guilty. The prosecution opposed his application to be released on bail arguing that he is likely to interfere with witnesses in the case. “There is credible information that will lead to apprehension of people on murder charges and other charges… There was a choreographed plan and a pattern in which these offences were committed. We require time,” submitted the prosecution. Also Read: The ruling on the bail application will be delivered on Thursday, September 16. Video Of The Day: Iconic city hotels staring at bleak future
