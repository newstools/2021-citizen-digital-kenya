Gor Mahia has confirmed parting ways with goalkeeper Samuel Njau, who joins Posta Rangers after only one year at K’Ogalo. According to the club Sporting Director Lordvic Aduda, Malian International Adama Keita, Mathews Gad, Boniface Oluoch, and Caleb Omondi will cover the department this season, although head coach Mark Harrison wanted to keep only three. ‘’I can confirm that Njau has left to join Posta Rangers. We now have four goalkeepers – Adama Keita, Boniface Oluoch, Caleb Omondi and Mathews Gad,’’ affirmed Aduda. Prior to his statement, there was speculation on which of the five goalkeepers would be dropped after Harrison laid bare his plan to work with only three. Njau joined Gor in September 2020 from Western Stima but was rarely handed play-time throughout his year-long stay at K’Ogalo. Mathews Gad has been the regular between the posts but recently, assistant coach Sammy ‘Pamzo’ Omollo heaped praise on Keita saying he offers god option for the position. Also Read: “I have seen him train with us and I can say he is a very good player. He will help the club a lot at the continental level and locally.” Aduda has in the meantime said they are still open to signing more players at the recommendation of the head coach. They have so far signed seven after FIFA lifted the transfer ban earlier imposed on them. ‘’At the recommendation of the head coach, we are still open to recruiting. He will advise on areas he still feels need reinforcement and we as the office will sit and act.’’ Gor Mahia has in the meantime lined up two local friendly matches during the two-week international break, as they prepare to face Al-Ahly of Sudan in the CAF Confederations Cup on October 16 in Khartoum.
