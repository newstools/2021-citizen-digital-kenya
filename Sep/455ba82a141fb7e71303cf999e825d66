The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) envisages to have all closed sections of the Nairobi Expressway reopened by latest October 15, 2021. In a new notice on the construction progress of the Nairobi Expressway, the highways authority says road sections between JKIA and Mlolongo, Westlands and the James Gichuru junction will be restored by Thursday next week (September 30). The section along the Haile Selassie-UoN roundabout will however be restored on October 15, 2021. Moreover, KeNHA says it has taken steps to manage traffic along the project’s course including the improvement of two directional U-turns at various points, opening several completed sections of the Expressway to give way for works on the existing highway and widening angles at diversion points. KeNHA however says traffic could still be experienced in areas currently under intervention including the GM (Isuzu East Africa) where a new footbridge is being installed and Bunyala round about and the Uhuru Highway where hoisting of box girders is still ongoing. The highways authority says the overall progress of the project presently stands at 62.6 per cent while the construction of the operation and monitoring center is at 93 per cent.
