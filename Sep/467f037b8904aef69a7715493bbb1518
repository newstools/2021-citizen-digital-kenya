A senior police officer was on Monday evening robbed of his firearm by armed robbers at Kizingo area in Mombasa County. Urban Sub-County Police commander George Kingi Bamba was driving home at around 10.30pm when he found a tuk-tuk parked on the middle of the road near his official residence. He stopped his car and got out to inquire what was happening, only for two armed men to emerge from the tuk tuk, ordering him to surrender. According to a police report on the incident, the thugs held the police boss at gun point and robbed him of his Jericho pistol which was loaded with 15 rounds of ammunition. They then retreated to the tuk tuk where a driver was on standby waiting to drive off. Attempts by the sub-county police commander to raise an alarm were futile as the thugs managed to escape.
