The Media Council of Kenya (MCK)  has demanded that Embakasi East Member of Parliament Babu Owino withdraws threats he issued to Citizen TV news editor Muraya Kariuki and issue an apology to the journalist. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the council termed the threats made by the controversial lawmaker as “intimidation and a major infringement on press freedom.” “Media Council of Kenya takes exception with the threats issued by Embakasi East MP Babu Owino to Citizen TV journalist Muraya Kariuki on his coverage of the ODM leader (Raila Odinga). This amounts to intimidation and a major infringement on press freedom. As the protector of media freedom in Kenya the Media Council of Kenya demands that the MP withdraws the threats and issues an appropriate apology to the journalist and the media fraternity,” reads the statement. MCK further advised Babu Owino to file any media grievances he has with the Media Complaints Commission which is legally mandated to handle such matters under section 27 of the Media Council Act, 2013 and issue appropriate remedies. “The Media Council of Kenya condemns any actions by politicians to threaten journalists as they undertake their rightful duties. We urge politicians and leaders to uphold decorum in engaging with the media; to promote positive dialogue as we get into the electioneering period,” added the commission.
