Deputy President William Ruto has welcomed Catholic Bishops’ offer to negotiate a cease-fire between him and President Uhuru Kenyatta. On Thursday, when meeting a delegation of religious and grassroots leaders from Kandara at his Karen home, the Deputy President said that he is ready and willing to meet with the Head of State. “Hawa maaskofu wamesema wanataka kuniweka pamoja na rais, mimi niko tayari asubuhi na mapema, without conditions, sababu naheshimu Rais yeye ni mdosi wangu,” DP Ruto told the delegation. The DP attributed the rift between him and the president to “outsiders” who “wanted to profit from a government they didn’t form.” “Huwezi kudoea serial ambayo hukuunda,” the DP added, saying the March 2018 handshake between the ODM leader Raila Odinga and the president was the straw that broke the camel’s back. “Kuna watu tu wakora walikuja hapo wakasema huyu deputy president kwanza tuweke kando,” the DP said “Lakini mimi niko ready wakati wowote without conditions,” His allies, including Kandara MP Alice Wahome, used the opportunity to attack the President’s loyalists, claiming that the BBI push thwarted by a court orde had left them orphaned and without plan. “We would ask you to adopt the BBI orphans into UDA, they had banked all their hopes in the BBI, sasa, it is not your fault, you told them things were not okay kisheria,” MP Wahome said. Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichungwa, who was also present, poured cold water on the stalled BBI Bill, claiming that Kenya has not lost because some policies, such as increasing revenue to counties, can still be fulfilled by intentional government policy.
