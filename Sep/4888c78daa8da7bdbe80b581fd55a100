Inspector General of police Hillary Mutyambai has challenged newly promoted Police FC to win the Kenyan league title when the competition kicks off next weekend. Police earned promotion to the premier league after a 2-1 aggregate win over relegated Vihiga United and now the police boss has challenged his side to fight for the title with the big boys in the top division. “I support the team to be even stronger in the next level, we have earned this promotion on merit and we are in the league to compete with the best and fight for trophies in all competitions,” said the police boss. He added that their promotion to the premier league will enhance their efforts in community policing as other players and fans will have the opportunity to interact with the police in a more free way. “It’s a good chance to continue with community policing when we interact with the fans and other players from different teams. We will support this team to the best way possible and we believe we can win the league because nothing is impossible ,”added the police inspector.
