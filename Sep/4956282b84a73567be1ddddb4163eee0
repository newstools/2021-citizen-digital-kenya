McLaren’s Lando Norris took pole position in a thrilling rain-affected qualifying at the Russian Grand Prix. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton was only fourth after crashing in the pit lane mid-way through the final sessions and then spinning on his final lap, as drivers risked slick tyres in the closing stages. Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and Williams driver George Russell took advantage of Hamilton’s error to vault into second and third places. McLaren’s Daniel Ricciardo took fifth ahead of Alpine’s Fernando Alonso. It was a dramatic end to a session that at one stage earlier in the day looked as if it might not even take place, so heavy was the rain that started overnight and continued into the morning at the Black Sea resort of Sochi. And it was a case of missed opportunity for Mercedes, with Hamilton’s title rival Max Verstappen starting from the back of the grid as a result of a penalty for using too many engines.
