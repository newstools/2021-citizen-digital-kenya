KANU Chairman Gideon Moi has declared his bid for the 2022 presidential race. Moi said the party will make a declaration on September 30 this year at the Bomas of Kenya, where they will reveal their plans of securing the top seat. Speaking at his rural home in Sacho after attending a church service at African Inland Church (AIC) Tandui in Baringo Central on Sunday, Moi expressed optimism that he would trounce his opponents and called on his Kalenjin community to give him their blessings. The Baringo Senator promised that if given a chance, he would transform the country, especially areas that are still lagging behind in development. “I have already made an ultimate decision and I am not backing down, however tough the duel is. I am only asking my community to support me in this  journey and not backstab me. If I lose, I will have lost humbly than being despised and if I win, it will play to our advantage as well and I am very optimistic that we will trounce our opponents to clinch the presidency,” he said. “I promise that I will come back home after the Bomas of Kenya declaration next week to seek your blessings because we need to speak in one voice if my political ambition is to come into fruition.” Also Read:  Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
