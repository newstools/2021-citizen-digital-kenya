The national women’s volleyball team Malkia Strikers on Sunday stormed the African Nations Volleyball Championships final with an emphatic display against Morocco in the semi-finals at the Kigali Arena in the Rwandan capital. Malkia Strikers hit the North Africans in straight sets of 25-12, 25-21 and 25-11, to qualify for the finals set on Sunday evening, and at the same time booked the next year’s World Championships ticket to be co-hosted by Netherlands and Poland. The nine-time African champions will meet either defending champions Cameroon or Nigeria who were to face off later in the afternoon. This was the first match of the biennial championship which had been halted since Thursday night, after the hosts were found guilty of fielding four ineligible players, with the debacle threatening the cancellation of the tournament following a push and pull from Rwanda and the Confederation of African Volleyball (CAVB). On Saturday night, the African volleyball governing body then announced the resumption of action while suspending Rwanda, who were set to meet with the Kenyans at the semi-finals. Nigeria, who had filed a complaint against Rwanda, replaced the hosts after finishing third in pool ‘A’. Also Read:  Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
