KCB defender Badi Baraka is eyeing more national team call ups. So far Badi has three call ups under his belt, the latest coming in the recent international break where he suffered an ankle injury thus locking him out of Harambee Stars twin matches against Uganda and Rwanda. Despite the setback, he’s aiming to work hard to catch the eye of Stars head coach Jacob ‘Ghost’ Mulee. He said: “It’s every player’s dream to play for their national team.  It feels special to be recognized as one of the best for that position and I’m looking forward to many call ups. That can only happen if I keep working hard and maintain discipline in my career.” Badi who played all the matches for the bankers this season also spoke about the lessons learned while playing alongside foreign-based players. “Training with them always makes a player better because they have been exposed more to the world, I have always learnt a lot from them anytime we interact during the national team call-ups, and with hard work I hope I will join their league,”added Badi.
