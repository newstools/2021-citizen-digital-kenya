Andy Murray defeated Canada’s Vasek Pospisil to move into the quarter-finals of the Moselle Open in France. The British former world number one, 34, won 6-3 6-3 to set up a tie against either France’s Lucas Pouille or top seed Hubert Hurkacz of Poland. “I’ve not played this many tournaments in a while and my body feels good,” said Murray. “I’m gaining confidence and seeing the points develop. The results are coming and my tennis is getting better.” On Tuesday, Murray fought back from a set down to defeat world number 26 Ugo Humbert 4-6 6-3 6-2 in the first round.
