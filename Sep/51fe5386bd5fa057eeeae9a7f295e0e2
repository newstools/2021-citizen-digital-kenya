Ofafa Jericho High School in Nairobi has been closed for three days following a fire incident that left a number of students injured. Form Fours will return to the school on Friday, while students in Form One, Form Two and Form Three will return back on Monday. Fire investigators and police officers are presently in the school probing the cause of the fire that started at around 8pm on Monday night and razed down a dormitory. At least 40 students are said to have been admitted to Metropolitan Hospital in Buruburu due to carbon poisoning following the fire incident.
