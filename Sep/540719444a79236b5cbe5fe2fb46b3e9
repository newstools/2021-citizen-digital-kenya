Residents of Wangwachi, Ol-Moran are yet again mourning one of their own, 60-year-old Charles Maina was allegedly killed by suspected bandits who continue to terrorise residents. He was herding his livestock together with others herders. A witness said the late Maina was attacked by four heavily armed bandits who shot him six times before driving away with his 30 cattle. “Wenye niliona walikuwa wanne, watatu walikuwa mbele ya ngombe na mwengine alikuwa amenyemelea wale tulikuwa nao sasa wakati wakaniita nikaona mwenye alikuwa nyuma yao nikawaambia wajaribu wajiokoe sasa mimi nikalala na nikatoroka kisha wakakuja wakaskuma ngombe hata hawakuwa na haraka,”  Samuel Ruchuiri,  a resident said. Residents have blamed the police for failing to deal with the attackers who have resorted to carrying out day time attacks after the government imposed a dawn to dusk curfew in the area two weeks ago. “Hawa officers wanapiga patrol lakini hata wakipiga patrol wanapita na hawa wengine wanawaona wakiwa kwa mahindi wanachungulia na hatujui mahali wanaingilia,” Susan Njeri told Citizen TV. “Tunauliza serikali kama kuna mahali wametutengenezea watupeleke hapo kwa sababu kila wakati wanapatiana mambo ya oparesheni hakuna oparesheni tunaona ikifanyika,” George Karuiru , the MCA, Ol Moran said.
