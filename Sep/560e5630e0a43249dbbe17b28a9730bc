The High Court has quashed the appointment of Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (NAMATA) board members pending hearing and deternation of a case challenging the appointments. The Court said the appointment of three board members; Mary Chege, Zachariah Mungai, and Ronald Ndegwa; failed to meet the Constitutional requirements applicable in Public Service Appointments. Further, the court noted that the appointments, from one community, are not representative of the country’s diversity fabric. The three had been appointed to the position by chairperson of Nairobi metropolitan area council, James Machariain a Gazette Notice dated February 5, this year. The matter was however taken to court through a petition by advocate Manwa Hosea. The Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (NAMATA) seeks to provide a mechanism for the establishment of an integrated, efficient and sustainable transport system within the Metropolitan area.
