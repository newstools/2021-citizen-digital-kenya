Chelsea have been fined Sh3.7 million for failing to control their players in the 1-1 Premier League draw against Liverpool at Anfield last month, the Football Association (FA) said on Wednesday. Chelsea players clashed with their Liverpool counterparts and referee Anthony Taylor after the latter decided to send off defender Reece James in first-half stoppage time for handball and award a penalty, which Mohamed Salah converted. Kai Havertz’s headed goal had put Chelsea in front before Salah levelled from the spot. Chelsea’s 10 men held firm for a point however, leaving both sides unbeaten three matches into the new league campaign. “The club admitted failing to ensure that its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion during both the 48th minute of the first half and following the half-time whistle,” the FA said in a statement. Chelsea host Aston Villa on Saturday and Liverpool travel to Leeds United on Sunday. Video Of The Day: People living with disability call for inclusion in vaccination drive
