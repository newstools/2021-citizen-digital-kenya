Tom Oywa Mboya, the businessman who shot Ranalo Foods restaurant owner William Osewe, has been found guilty of attempted murder. A Nairobi court also found Mboya guilty of unlawfully wounding another man, Wilfred Tembula, who was injured during the incident. The businessman will be sentenced on October 4, 2021 in a ruling that will be read by Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku. He will be held at the Industrial Area remand prison awaiting the sentencing. Mboya is said to have shot Mr. Osewe multiple times in December 2016 at Garden Estate in Kasarani following an argument over Stella Mutheu, a woman believed to be the latter’s wife. Mr. Osewe was admitted at the Aga Khan Hospital’s High Dependency Unit (HDU) where he underwent surgeries to remove the bullets.
