The prosecution closed its case in the murder trial of slain lawyer Willie Kimani, his client, and a driver on Thursday, after presenting all of the evidence and witnesses it intended to present. The prosecution’s last witness took to the stand on Thursday. The trial judge is expected to rule on whether the accused are guilty or not of the offense, after which the defense will make their arguments. Willie Kimani was murdered in 2016 together with his client Josephat Mwenda and a taxi driver Joseph Muiruri in what sparked outrage in the legal fraternity. The Willy Kimani murder case against four police officers has dragged in court taking a slow dive over the past two years. The ascension of Justice Jessie Lessit to the Court of Appeal had threatened to delay the case further with Chief Justice Martha Koome allowing the judge to continue hearing the matter. Since 2016, 44 prosecution witnesses have taken the stand, detailing the events that led to the death of the three and the ultimate dumping of their bodies in a river at Oldonyo Sabuk until their decomposing bodies were recovered one week after their disappearance.
