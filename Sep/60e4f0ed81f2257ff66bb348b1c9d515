The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) has launched probe into a shooting incident along Nairobi’s Kirinyaga road in which a man was reportedly gunned down by a  police officer. The Authority, in a statement on Saturday, said a Rapid Response Team had already been dispatched to obtain all relevant information that will clear the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting. “Where fault is found, the Authority shall not hesitate to make recommendations, including but not limited to prosecution,”  the IPOA said on Saturday. At the same time, the Authority urged calm among those affected by the incident, asking them to allow the law to take its course. Earlier on Saturday, Boda Boda riders engaged police officers in chaotic running battles in which tyres were lit, roads barricaded and teargas lobbed. Witnesses said the rider who was shot was in an altercation with a plain clothed officer when the shooting happened. Its cause, however remains unclear. Starehe MP Charles Njagua alias “Jaguar” was among hundreds of protesters who picketed over the alleged police brutality. Meanwhile, the IPOA is also probing another incident in Nyeri involving a police officer accused of shooting a man dead in Gatung’ang’a. “The Independent Policing Oversight Authority has learnt of a shooting involving the police at Gatung’ang’a, Nyeri County,” the IPOA said on Saturday. “A man sustained bullet wounds during the Friday incident, September 24, 2021” Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
