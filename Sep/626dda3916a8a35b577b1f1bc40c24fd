Over 150 families in Ol Moran, Laikipia County, spent Sunday night in the cold after arsonists torched 40 houses barely 24 hours after the National Security Advisory Council meeting on insecurity in the area. Hundreds of residents have fled the area which has for the last two months experienced rampant insecurity despite police operations. Residents, in the company of police officers, searched through the remains of their houses in an effort to salvage any valuable. They say the latest attack follows the arrest of two suspected bandits at Ol Moran centre by security agencies whom they want released. “Walifanya vitisho vya kuja kutuambia tuhame maana sisi ndio tunafyeka hii msituni mahali wanakaa…jana ndio ilifikia nikaona watu wako huko ng’ambo wanapitapita tu, kukaribia nikaona wanajificha kwa kichaka,” said Sebastian Malope, one of the residents. The suspected bandits who were armed with guns, bows and arrows are said to have been hiding in a maize plantation while carrying out the attacks and evading police officers who have been deployed to deal with the criminals.
