Manchester City will have to field several youngsters in Tuesday’s League Cup clash against Wycombe Wanderers as a number of players are suffering from injuries, manager Pep Guardiola said. “I don’t have any alternative (against Wycombe)… we are going to play a few young players,” Guardiola was quoted as saying by the club’s website on Sunday. “We have John (Stones), Aymeric (Laporte), Oleks (Zinchenko), Rodri and I think (Ilkay) Gundogan all of them injured. “It’s a good opportunity for the academy – that’s why they are there.” Following the match against Wycombe, City face Premier League leaders Chelsea, Paris St Germain in the Champions League and then Liverpool within a space of nine days, meaning the injuries are causing Guardiola a considerable amount of concern. “Some players might rest for the games we have coming up ahead of us,” he added.
