The County Director of Health, Dr. George Karoki, has said that designated vaccination centers have been increased from 9 to 22 in order to increase access for residents in the interior parts of the country. Dr. Karoki who was addressing the media at Thiba Dispensary cautioned residents to avoid receiving the vaccines from undesignated points pointing out that only the designated ones have the required capacity to offer the vaccines which include specially trained staff. “We discourage the public from receiving vaccines in unregistered centers especially in rallies as this is likely to jeopardize their health safety,” he said, adding that all vaccines given to the public must be received and logged into the system and coordinated by the department of health at the county level as per the MOH guidelines. The director added that the designated vaccination centers are fully compliant the Ministry of Health guidelines and protocols which are in line with the World Health Organization (WHO).
