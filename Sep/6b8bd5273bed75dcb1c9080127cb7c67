ODM leader Raila Odinga concluded his three-day visit of Laikipia with stop overs at Narumoru, Chaka and finally Karatina in Nyeri county and a meeting with four governors from the region as he steps up efforts to woo the mountain. The ODM Supremo said he is willing to work with the region and smaller parties from the mountain, saying there are those that have shown interest in joining his band wagon. “We were discussing with Jubilee and several other parties in this region and we shall be looking at it in a case-by-case basis. This is part of consultative meetings we are holding across the country so that we can identify the problems affecting different parts of the country and come up with policies to address those issues,” said Odinga. In his tour, the former prime minister rubbished the bottom-up approach being propagated by Deputy President William Ruto saying the region stands to benefit with a Raila presidency. The governors on their part disclosed that they have been in talks with the ODM leader to ensure the region benefits from his presidency. “We have discussed inclusion of stimulus package to cushion MSMEs that have been devasted by the global economic factors as well as unfavourable policy. We note that the MSME sector is the largest employer in the region, therefore we shall lobby and champion the enactment of friendly policies,” said Laikipia Governor Nderitu Mureithi.
