A Nairobi court has allowed Samburu Governor Moses Kasaine Lenolkulal to travel to Greece for official duties. The court allowed the application by the governor to have his passport released in order to process his visa and travel. The court, however, ordered the governor to return the passport in court once he is back in the country. He was also ordered to file an affidavit before travelling, declaring who is his contact person in Kenya. In the application, the Governor says he has been invited to be part of a delegation of Governors to engage in talks towards developing economic relations with relevant stakeholders. The meeting is scheduled to take place in the Hellenic Republic from September 25 to October 2. The Governor was charged with corruption charges and he’s out on a cash bail.
