Sigalame High School in Funyula, Busia County, has been closed indefinitely after a fire razed one of the dormitories on Monday night. This becomes the fourth fire incident in the school since it was reopened this term. Samia sub-county Director of Education Dominic Opee said the students will remain home until investigations into the cause of the fire are concluded. The learners early Tuesday morning caused a fracas when they chased away the school guards, injuring one of them in the process. Police officers have however since restored order in the institution.
