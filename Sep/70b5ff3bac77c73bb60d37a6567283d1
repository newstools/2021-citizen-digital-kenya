The High Court has declined to issue orders stopping the swearing-in of the four newly-appointed IEBC Commissioners. Justice Weldon Korir, in a brief ruling on Thursday, noted that the country is heading towards elections and any further delay in swearing-in of the commissioners poses danger for Kenyans. “It’s in public interest that the conservatory orders should not be granted,” the judge noted. He further observed that with less than a year to the elections the electoral commission should be busy preparing for the polls. “The petitioner’s conservatory order is for dismissal,” the court directed. The appointment of the four commissioners; Juliana Cherera, Francis Mathenge, Irene Masit and Justus Abonyo has since been Gazetted following successful vetting by Parliament.
