Bernd Leno is facing an uncertain future, with Arsenal contemplating selling the goalkeeper next summer. The Germany international’s place in Mikel Arteta’s plans was thrown into doubt on Saturday when £30million summer arrival Aaron Ramsdale was handed a surprise start for the game against Norwich, a selection that helped Arsenal secure their first Premier League victory of the season. Arteta was glowing in his praise of Ramsdale after the victory, with the England international now expected to keep his place in the team. It places Leno’s future at the Emirates under a cloud heading into the rest of the season. There is little chance of the Gunners agreeing to sell Leno in January, even if the 29-year-old does not win his place back in the starting XI. But they would look to do a deal for him next summer if their goalkeeping situation goes according to plan. Sportsmail understands that Arsenal signed Ramsdale in the expectation that he would be No 1 by the end of the season, a scenario that would probably prompt offers for Leno next year.
