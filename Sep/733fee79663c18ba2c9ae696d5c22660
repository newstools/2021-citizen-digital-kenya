Kenyan musician, Juliani who alleges he has been threatened because of his friendship with Governor Alfred Mutua’s estranged wife, Lillian Ng’ang’a, has filed a police report at Kileleshwa police station. The issue was brought to light by activist Boniface Mwangi, who alleges that Juliani, a close friend of his, had received a warning by phone call and text message. “My very good friend JulianiKenya was threatened yesterday. Someone called him and texted using 0773912088. He told him to stop posting pics posed with his friend Lillyanne Nganga,” Boniface Mwangi Tweeted on Thursday “if he continues, they will kill him. He has recorded a statement at Kileleshwa Police Station,” Mwangi appeared to back up the claims that the artist and the governor’s ex-wife are courting in his update. “We must respect personal choices, love who you want, it is your life, love is a personal life,” Mwangi added. Juliani had scoffed at rumors that he was now cozying up to the governor’s ex-flame just a day before. The artist who has been seen in multiple eye-catching images with the former Machakos County First Lady, took to Twitter to say that it was time to lay the juicy headlines and false narrative of “ulinyang’anyana” to rest. It is impossible, he claims, to snatch an intellectual adult with a sound mind from another person. He did not say if he is dating Ms Ng’ang’a, but he did reveal that he has received death threats as a result of their association. “For the threats,usi aim face,na prefer niki smile kwa open casket,” Juliani Tweeted. The musician hit the headlines shortly after Mutua and his wife went public over their relationship, revealing that they were no longer an item. Photos would emerge showing Juliani cavorting with Ms Ng’ang’a who has since her separation, stepped down as the Machakos County First lady.
