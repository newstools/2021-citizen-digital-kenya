A multi-agency taskforce has directed the office of the Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to launch a probe on two senior teachers at Thiru Primary School in Laikipia West for reportedly tying three pupils to a tree as punishment. The taskforce, led by Nyahururu sub-county Deputy County Commissioner Moses Muroki, spent the better part of Wednesday taking statements from teachers and pupils over the incident that took place last Friday. The DCC has since directed the Laikipia West DCI office to open investigations against the school headteacher Shelmith Thimba and her deputy David Maina. Mr. Maina is alleged to have tied the three pupils to a tree last Friday as a punishment for truancy and delinquency, before taking the now viral photos. He is then said to have posted the photos on the school teachers’ WhatsApp group before one of them leaked them to social media on Tuesday. Mr. Muroki, Ezekiel Mwanza (Laikipia County Director of Children Services), and Irene Kandenge (TSC) termed the act as inhuman and directed the DCI to take over investigations.
