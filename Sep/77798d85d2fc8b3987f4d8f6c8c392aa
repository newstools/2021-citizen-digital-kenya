Former Sports CS Hassan Wario on Wednesday was convicted of abuse of office over the siphoning off of funds meant for athletes who competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The court while convicting Wario said that he indeed took advantage of his office and had three individuals – Monica Sairo, Richard Abura and Aden Adow – as late inclusions to Team Kenya and have allowances issued to them. According to the court the late inclusions contributed to confusion that resulted to loss of public funds. “The additional names included after they closed the accreditation. Clearly this was an indicator that the three were not part of the Team Kenya,” the court ruled. Magistrate Elizabeth Juma further noted that Wario did not have the mandate to allow the three travel to Rio. Also convicted is Stephen Soi, who was the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Nock) chef de mission for Rio. He had been charged with two counts of theft involving more than $252,000 and other related offences and has been convicted over five counts.
