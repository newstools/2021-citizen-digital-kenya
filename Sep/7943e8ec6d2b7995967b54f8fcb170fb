Nzoia Sugar FC chairman Evans Kadenge says the club is working to clear player salary arrears ahead of an massive recruitment plan to shore up their championship chances. Nzoia finished the 2020/21 campaign ranked 14th on the FKF Premier League standings, a slight improvement from the previous season when they just narrowly escaped relegation. The club was outstanding at their Sudi backyard with only seven other teams posting a better home record, and will look to improve on the road next season. “I can’t give the names now but the new players are joining, the number one priority next season is the league trophy. We are beefing up the three departments; goalkeeping will remain untouched. “We performed well last season at home and we want to get even better this season now that we are a stronger team, we want to improve on away matches,” Kadenge said. He revealed a number of his first team players have attracted suitors from top FKF-PL clubs but that does not worry him.
