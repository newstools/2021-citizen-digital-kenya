Nzoia Sugar FC captain Peter Gin says his side paid the price of failing to take their chances as they fell 1-0 to Ulinzi Stars in their season-opening Football Kenya Federation Premier League fixture on Sunday. Mark Barasa scored from the spot in 34th minute to settle the contest between the sides at the Nakuru Show ASK Ground. “This is football and sometimes the unexpected does happen. We were well prepared and I think we dominated the proceedings from the first to the final whistle. We created chances but failed to convert them. They utilised theirs and made us pay,” Gin said. However, the midfielder is upbeat they can pocket all three points when they host Sofapaka in their next League assignment. Batoto ba Mungu launched their campaign with a 3-1 demolition of Nairobi City Stars. Also Read: Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
