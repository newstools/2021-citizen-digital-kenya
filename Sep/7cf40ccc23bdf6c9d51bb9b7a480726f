The Janet Mbugua-led Inua Dada foundation has won  2021’s World Association for Sexual Health award. The award was given at the recently concluded, Hivos-sponsored 25th Congress of the World Association for Sexual Health. The global organization, founded in 1978, recognizes, promotes, and advocates for sexual health and rights throughout the lifespan and throughout the world. Founded by media personality and author Janet Mbugua, the Inua Dada foundation has reached at least 15 million people online since its inception. “We are humbled to have our footprints reach a global audience at the World Association for Sexual Health (WAS)” the foundation said on Friday. The foundation stated in a press release on Friday that the award and recognition emphasize the importance of having sustained and inclusive conversations that shift toward a multi-stakeholder approach, creating safe spaces to improve access and learning, and leaning into innovation to maximize impact and outreach across communities and demographics. “The Inua Dada Foundation continues to advocate to ensure young women and girls from marginalised communities move from pain to power,” the statement from the foundation reads. One of the foundation’s key pillars is addressing the push for Menstrual Equity for all girls and women through community engagement, access to Menstrual products, and information on sexual reproductive health and rights. The foundation has also, through its book, My First Time, tackled taboos and myths surrounding menstrual health in many cultures and countries with the aim of challenging societal stigmas on Menstruation and providing psychosocial support for GBV survivors.
