Matatus operating inside the Nairobi Central Business District (CBD) face higher parking fees following the resumption of full-capacity operations last month. In a notice, the Nairobi City County Government and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) say they will reinstate ‘normal’ parking fees for the public service vehicles (PSVs) from Saturday next week. The City county government had previously discounted the parking charges on the request of matatu stakeholders following the limitation of PSVs carrying capacities to no more than 60 per cent per vehicle. From September 25, 14 seater matatus will pay a monthly fee of Ksh.5000 and Ksh.3650 as parking charges covering the sixth to the 24th day of the month and the 25th to the fifth day of the month respectively. Meanwhile minibuses will pay between Ksh.8000 and Ksh.5280 as parking charges covering a similar period while buses will pay between Ksh.10,000 and Ksh.7200 for the seasonal parking rates. The parking fees for PSVs had been discounted as a factor of carrying capacity which has been traditionally deployed to determine the parking rates.
