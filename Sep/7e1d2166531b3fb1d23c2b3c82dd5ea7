Two citizens have moved to court to challenge the recent fuel increase saying the decision failed to consider the common mwananchi. The two, Isaiah Odando and Wilson Yata, named the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA), National Assembly, as well as the Petroleum Cabinet Secretary as respondents. Among the orders that they are seeking is an order to quash the decision by the KRA Commissioner General to adjust excise duty rates for petroleum products effective October 1, 2021 subject to approval by the Cabinet Secretary and the National Treasury. According to the petitioners, the respondents have ignored proper public participation of Kenyans before adjusting the rates. They further argue that Kenyans have been subjected to heavy fuel tax notwithstanding that they are already overburdened. “The respondents have failed to be transparent and accountable to Kenyans on information as to why Kenyan fuel price retails higher as compared to its landlocked neighbors and has tax higher than the landed price of fuel,” read court papers.
