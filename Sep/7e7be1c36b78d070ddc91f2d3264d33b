Liverpool duo Trent Alexander-Arnold and Roberto Firmino are in line to return to the side for Saturday’s trip to Brentford, manager Juergen Klopp said on Thursday. Right back Alexander-Arnold missed the last two games due to illness, while forward Firmino has not been involved since injuring his hamstring against Chelsea at the end of the last month. “(Alexander-Arnold) is back in training, trained yesterday and will be fine… Bobby (Firmino) trained already for two or three days, so he is back in contention … but he will be in normal training and then we have to make a decision,” Klopp told the club website. The German added that midfielder James Milner and right back Neco Williams were also back in training. However, midfielders Naby Keita – who picked up an injury in the League Cup win against Norwich City on Tuesday – and Thiago Alcantara remain sidelined. “(With Keita), it’s not a serious thing but we have to wait until the pain settles … Thiago, no chance,” said Klopp. Liverpool, who beat Crystal Palace in the Premier League last week, are second in the table. Brentford are ninth. Also Read: Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
