The government has frozen pararrel celebrations of this year’s Mashujaa Day in counties across the country. In a statement issued on Friday, Interior PS Dr. Karanja Kibicho said the holiday will only be marked in Kirinyaga deviation from the traditional practice where County Commissioners lead similar celebrations
at the grassroots. “Kirinyaga County will be the host for this year’s Mashujaa Day. No celebrations
will be held in other counties as it has always been the case. We don’t want to escalate the
spread of Covid-19, and that is why we are freezing similar activities in other counties,” he said. Dr. Kibicho was speaking after inspecting ongoing works at Wanguru Stadium, the venue for the event on October 20. According to the PS, the facility is almost 80 percent complete and will be delivered by
October 5th alongside the County Commissioner’s residence in Kerugoya, which will double up as a State Lodge. “We are satisfied with the progress made so far. From the brief we have received from the
construction team, we have never been closer to this level of preparation ahead of national
holiday. This and other infrastructure meant to facilitate this year’s event will be ready by
October 5,” he said. Also Read: Kirinyaga will join Nakuru, Machakos, Meru, Nyeri, Kakamega, Mombasa, Narok, and Kisii
