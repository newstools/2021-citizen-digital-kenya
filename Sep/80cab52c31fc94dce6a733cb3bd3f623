The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has expressed concern over the country’s increased political activities, claiming that they are causing unnecessary tension. During a press conference on Friday to introduce the newly inducted commissioners, the IEBC urged Kenyan politicians to stop running unlawful campaigns, saying that the official campaign period is clearly outlined in the Elections Operations. “The Commission appeals to political players and stakeholders to avoid this trend as the official campaign period is outlined in the Election Operations.” the Commission said. At the same time, the commission, which reaffirmed its mission to deliver credible elections in 2022, urged security authorities to ensure that elections are held in a secure environment. “The Commission is also pleased to announce that the Chairman and the Six Commissioners have given their personal commitment in supporting one another and working very closely with the Secretariat in order to deliver a successful and credible 2022 General Election,” the commission added. Meanwhile, in a 30-day exercise due to begin in October, the commission aims to register at least 6,000,000 new voters at the County Assembly level. “We urge all eligible Kenyans who have not registered as voters to turn up in large numbers and register,” The commission added. The IEBC also urged the government to ensure that adequate funds are disbursed on time to allow for the implementation of planned programs.
