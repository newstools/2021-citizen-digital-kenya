Former Brazilian soccer great Pele remains in an intensive care unit and is recovering satisfactorily almost a week after surgery to remove a tumor from his colon, his doctors said on Friday. Pele “is conscious, conversing actively and is maintaining normal vital signs,” a statement from the Alberto Einstein hospital in Sao Paulo said. In a separate social media post, the 80-year-old three times World Cup winner said he was feeling better and joked he still had hopes of playing again. “My friends, with each passing day I feel a little better,” he said on Instagram. “I’m looking forward to playing again, but I’m still going to recover for a few more days.” “While I’m here, I take the opportunity to talk a lot with my family and to rest.” Pele’s doctors discovered the tumor last week during his annual medical and he was operated on last Saturday. It was not clear if the tumor was cancerous.
