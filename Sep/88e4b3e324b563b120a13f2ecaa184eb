Emma Raducanu’s “very special” US Open win has presented British tennis with a “huge opportunity” to attract more people to the sport, says three-time Grand Slam winner Andy Murray. The 18-year-old became the country’s first woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in 44 years when she beat Leylah Fernandez in the final. She also became the first qualifier in history to claim a major. “It was incredible what she did there,” former US Open champion Murray said. “What she did in New York was very special, a huge boost for British tennis and gives hopefully the governing bodies an opportunity to capitalise on that and get more and more kids involved in the sport. It’s great what she did and a huge opportunity for British tennis now.” Murray, 34, said he is like many others involved in British tennis who “knew she was extremely good” and that Raducanu’s run to the fourth round at Wimbledon was a telling “glimpse of how good she could be”.

Murray progresses in Rennes Open Murray spoke about Raducanu’s US Open triumph in a news conference at the Rennes Open where he eased past Germany’s Yannick Maden to reach the second round. Fifth seed Murray, who was given a wildcard to play in the second-tier ATP Challenger Tour event, took just 74 minutes to beat Maden 6-3 6-1. It was the 34-year-old’s first match since going down in five sets to world number three Stefanos Tsitsipas in the first round of the US Open. Murray next faces either qualifier Manuel Guinard or Roman Safiullin. Meanwhile, fellow Briton Heather Watson was beaten 6-1 6-3 in the first round of the Zavarovalnica Sava Portoroz in Slovenia by Romania’s Sorana Cirstea.
