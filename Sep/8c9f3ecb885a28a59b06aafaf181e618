Seven people have been arrested in connection with the illegal diversion and administration of vaccines, as the government continues to issue stern warnings against those profiteering from vaccines  meant for the public. Health Principal Secretary Susan Mochache said the seven individuals are set to be charged in court. “There are seven people who have already been arrested they will face the law, we are against vaccine profiteering as vaccines should be free for all,” she said. The PS was speaking as she received additional doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from Canada. She said the Ministry of Health in collaboration with other relevant security agencies will ensure that individuals taking advantage of the vaccination  process, for purposes of political gain as was the case in Murang’a last month, or profiteering, will be nabbed and face the full force of the law for their acts of omission and commission. Meanwhile, the Ruai Family Hospital has two weeks to account for the vaccines issued to the facility while the nurse who handled the vaccines, if found culpable, by the nursing council will have her licence revoked.
