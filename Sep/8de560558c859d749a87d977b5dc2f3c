Nzoia Sugar chairman Evans Kadenge is not a worried man despite the club losing their top striker Hillary Simiyu and a number of his players being linked with moves elsewhere. Simiyu was signed by the soldiers immediately after the end of the FKF-PL 2020-2021 season thanks to his sharpshooting skills that saw him bang nine goals for the sugar men who had roped him in from Bungoma Superstars FC. According to the former AFC Leopards player, Nzoia cannot stop players from joining other outfits since Western region is rich in young talents who are tapped from schools like; Bukembe, St Anthony Boys Kitale and Toloso Secondary School just to mention a few. “That’s the challenge we are experiencing because it seems like our job is to sharpen the boys and give them the platform only for other teams to come and snatch them from us,” Kadenge said adding that, “We can’t stand on their way when they get greener pastures elsewhere because we have more than enough talents from schools like; Bukembe, St Anthony Boys Kitale and Toloso Secondary just to mention a few from Western region.  When a player leaves, it is very easy to get another one to fill the position,” he charged.

Last season was very hard for us because we were forced to play most of our home matches away because of the Covid-19 restrictions which required us to travel for long distances with matches coming quick and fast,” Kadenge concluded. Under head coach Ibrahim Shikanda, Nzoia finished in position 14 on 33 points, only 11 ahead of Western Stima who were relegated to NSL.
