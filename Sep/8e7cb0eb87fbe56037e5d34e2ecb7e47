Olympic 1500m champion Faith Kipyegon is eyeing victory at tomorrow’s Kip Keino Classic before closing curtains on what has been an outstanding season. Her superb form this year saw her successfully defend her Olympic title as well as the Diamond League trophy and now the 27-year-old can round it off with cheer at home. The world silver medallist says she is eager to compete in her first international event held on home soil. “I am happy to compete here at home in this big event. This being my last race of the season I hope to enjoy myself and to close the season strongly,” Kipyegon said. She will begin her off-season after the event before embarking on preparations for next year’s World Championships to be held in Oregon, USA. “For next year I am aiming to reclaim my title at the World Championships in Eugene and therefore I will be taking a short break after Kip Keino Classic before I commence my preparations,” Kipyegon said.
