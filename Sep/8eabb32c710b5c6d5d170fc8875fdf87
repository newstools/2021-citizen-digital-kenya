National carrier Kenya Airways has signed a deal with South African Airways (SAA) which it hopes will in future lead to the formation of a pan-african airline. The deal comes only a week after SAA flew its first plane since March 2020 after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings with its fleet down to six planes, from a previous 46. Kenya Airways CEO Allan Kilavuka however says the deal is expected to make the two airlines competitive in the continent. Killavuka has recently rooted for consolidation of African airlines to make them efficient. KQ has been facing financial turbulence compounded by a decline in air travel due to the global Covid-19 pandemic.
