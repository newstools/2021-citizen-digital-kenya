ODM party officials in Alego/Usonga constituency, Siaya County have been instructed to embark on a door-to-door campaign on ID card and voter registration drive to increase the number of registered voters in the region. ODM’s Alego/Usonga branch chairman John Orwenjo Umidha has directed them to ensure that all potential voters are registered in readiness for next year’s general elections. He stated that their main target is to increase the number of registered voters even up to 200,000 and therefore encouraged those who have not yet registered as voters to take advantage of the mass voter registration exercise that will kick off next on October 4th. Mr. Orwenjo gave the remarks during their meeting at the ODM Alego/Usonga branch offices in Siaya town attended by nominated MP Prof. Jackline Oduol. Ms. Oduol said this is the time for people to come together and mobilize each other to register as voters irrespective of their political affiliations. She said that the main aim of striving to increase their voter registration numbers is to ensure they strengthen ODM leader Raila Odinga’s political strength even as he prepares to give his fifth stab at the country’s top seat.
