Harambee Stars striker Eric Kapaito on Wednesday joined newly promoted Ethiopian Premier League side Arba Minch City on a two-year contract. Kapaito who was named last season’s FKF Premier League Most Valuable Player is the second Kenyan to join the club, after Bernard Ochieng who parted ways with Wazito FC a fortnight ago. A week ago, Kapaito had told Citizen Digital that he was on his way out of Kariobangi Sharks, the club he scored for 24 goals last season to win the Golden Boot. “My desire is to win the Premier League medal as I have already won the MVP and Golden Boot and other individual awards. I may be at Sharks or elsewhere but that is my dream is to win a league title. “It’s always a player’s dream to play away from after making some impact at home especially in this side of the continent. If all goes well I could move because a number of clubs are interested in me,” said Kapaito, on the night he won the 2020/2021 FKF-PL MVP. Kapaito who also played for Talanta FC also won the MVP award and the Golden Boot in the 2018 season in his maiden season with Sharks.
