Two foreigners from Burundi were on Wednesday morning arrested in Isebania, Migori County, and handed over to the immigration office. Kuria West sub-county Police Commander Cleti Kimaiyo said the foreigners were arrested at Isebania stage on the Migori-Isebania road by multi-agency officers on a patrol. Mr. Kimaiyo said they suspect the duo had just made their way into the county and were transiting to an unknown destination before they were nabbed. The police boss said the foreigners have since been handed over to the immigration department which is doing an investigation before repatriating them. He added that the crackdown on foreigners getting into the country without valid documents is still underway. A report from security agencies and Red Cross indicated that many foreigners from Burundi have been coming into the country to seek asylum in the recent past.
