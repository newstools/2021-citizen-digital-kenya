One Administration officer was burnt to death and several properties destroyed following a fire that broke out at the Siaya AP line in a suspected suicide on Thursday morning. According to eye witnesses led by Moses Omondi, the fire was discovered around 8.00 am but the efforts to put it out were in vain. He told Radio Ramogi that the fire started in the deceased officer’s house which was at the furthest end and was fast spreading towards other houses, adding that their attempt to reach the house in order to rescue the officer failed since the house had already been engulfed in flames. “Nilikuwa natoka kupeleka mtoto shuleni, nikaona kuna moto kubwa sana, tulijaribu kusaidia lakini shugli ilitatizwa na moshi uliotoka kwenye nyumbe ile ya AP line,” the eye witness, Moses Omondi told Radio Ramogi. Felix Ochieng’, another witness stated that they managed to rescue a few items from the adjacent houses before Siaya County government’s firefighting engine arrived at the scene almost an hour later and managed to put out the fire. He says that as they continued to remove items from the burnt house is when a lifeless body of the officer was discovered inside his house that was extensively burnt. Mimi ni mou wa boda boda hapa Siaya town, tulitoa vitu lakini baada ya moto kuzimwa, tukapata mwili was AP officer hapo ndani,” Ochieng said. Siaya County Commissioner Mohammed Barre while confirming the incident stated that the real cause of the fire which left adjacent houses seriously destroyed has not been established. He said that the body of the Administration Police officer who died has been removed to Siaya County referral hospital mortuary to await postmortem as investigations continue to ascertain what caused the fire.
