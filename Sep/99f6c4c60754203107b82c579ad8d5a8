A house fire in the Mashuru area of Kajiado county killed five family members on Thursday night, according to reports. Three children, their mother, and a domestic worker were among those killed in the fire. The man of the house, Saitoti Maina, was out of the house at the time of the incident. According to Jonathan Sikongei, the local assistant chief, the Thursday 10 p.m. fire was likely triggered by an electric short-circuit. “Tulipata habari kuwa kuna watt watano wameangamia kwenye moto wa stima, tukakimbilia hapa na tukajaribu kuwaokoa lakini haingewezekana,” Mr Sikongei said. A family member, Paul Maina said the cooking gas was found intact after the fire had been put out. “Moto ilianzia saa nne kamili jana usiku, tulipata kuwa kulikuwa na short ya stima sababu gas ilikuwa intact kwa scene,” Maina told Citizen Digital. The bodies of the five were removed to the Kajiado County Referral Hospital mortuary as probe to ascertain the cause of the fire kicks off.
