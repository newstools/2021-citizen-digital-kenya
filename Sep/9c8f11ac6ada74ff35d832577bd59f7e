A 34-year-old man died on Thursday after sustaining serious injuries from a vicious attack by his lover’s ex-boyfriend. According to a report by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), John Tagei, 34, had gone to visit his lover Loise Kanini at her house on Thursday at around 7.a.m. “After a while,  Kanini noticed that her son had left his keys at home. She went after him leaving Tagei in the house,” the police report says. On her way back to the house, she was reportedly confronted by her ex-lover, Joseph Macharia who demanded to know why she was hosting another man in her house. “Kanini retorted that following their breakup, she had moved on with her life and the man inside her house had since taken her heart captive,” the report from DCI reads. Police officers familiar with the matter say that the 33-year-old Macharia stormed his ex-lover’s house, attacking Mr.Tagei who was at the time, relaxing and waiting for his woman. “What followed was a confrontation that turned ugly, leaving Tagei with life threatening injuries,” the police said. After the vicious attack, Mr Tagei was rushed to the Wangige level IV hospital in critical condition by Kanini and other well-wishers. According to the police, he was transferred to the PCEA Thogoto hospital where he succumbed to injuries. The crime scene was documented by Kabete based detectives and a man hunt for the suspect who is still at large launched.
