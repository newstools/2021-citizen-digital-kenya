The National Security Advisory Council (NSAC) will meet on Saturday morning to review the security situation in Laikipia County, a statement from the Interior Ministry has said. Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said the government was changing its approach to insecurity in the country after various interventions failed to restore peace. In a strongly worded statement, PS Kibicho said the recent killing of one person was the breaking point of government’s patience. “The Cabinet Secretary issued an order, but we haven’t seen the desired response. We have tried persuasion and diplomatic approaches in vain. The Regional Commissioner is on the ground negotiating on our behalf, but nothing positive seems forthcoming. This is a matter we are now taking very seriously,” Kibicho said on Friday. PS Kibicho also questioned the commitment of local leaders to peace efforts in Laikipia and neighboring counties. The PS expressed dismay that some area leaders had previously thwarted peace efforts.
