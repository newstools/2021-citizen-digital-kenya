Winger Hansel Ochieng is set to leave AFC Leopards after two years at the club after he opted against extending his contract which expired during the just concluded season. Lack of play time, being fielded out of position and financial instability at Leopards are some of the reasons the former Nzoia Sugar player has elected to walk away. The 24-year-old is now weighing up his options among four unnamed FKF Premier League clubs which have shown interest. “I feel that without enough playtime I’m unable to achieve my expectations and so I have to move on. I have also been fielded as a right winger as opposed to what I prefer, which is to play as a striker,” Ochieng said. Under head coach Patrick Aussems, Ochieng has mostly been used as a substitute player with his only goal at Leopards coming during a cameo against Nairobi City Stars at the Kasarani Annex in March, Ochieng added he felt Leopards should have won at least one title last season but ‘bad luck’ stood in their way, adding he wished them well for the future.
