A suspect is presently nursing his injuries at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital after jumping from the third floor of an apartment to escape police arrest. Didmus Mong’are jumped from his kitchen balcony at Amani apartments in Embakasi and broke his limbs when he landed. Police officers had reportedly stormed the suspect’s house to place him under arrest for allegedly obtaining money by false pretenses. “However, in a bid to trick the officers, Mong’are emerged from his bedroom naked, prompting the officers to allow him time to dress up,” read the police report. “But as fate would have it, after putting on a pair of denim pants and a checked shirt, Mong’are mischievously dashed to the kitchen and flew from the balcony.” The very police officers who had showed up to arrest him administered first aid to him before rushing him to hospital for specialized attention.
