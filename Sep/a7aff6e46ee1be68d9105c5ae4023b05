Sofapaka president Elly Kalekwa has set the league title as the team’s target for the new FKF-PL 2021-2022 season. The 2009 champions have blown hot and cold since making an unprecedented top finish in their first season in the country’s top tier league. But Kalekwa is confident that the Batoto Ba Mungu are competitive enough to lift the title again. “Target remains the usual one because Sofapaka as you know is a big team. When the season begins our target always will remain to be lifting the league title and nothing else is bigger than this.  We once won it and so we can’t go into a season with a lesser aim,” Kalekwa stated. As Kalekwa demands for results from the technical bench led by head coach Ken Odhiambo, he acknowledges there were financial issues last season they need to address this term. “It is not that we were not paying the players but what was happening last season is only that we were paying them salaries late. There was a program collision since our sponsors had planned to have their sponsorship deal go to May but unfortunately corona challenges forced the league calendar to stretch the league to the month of August and so this affected everything as far as paying our players is concerned,” Kalekwa revealed.
