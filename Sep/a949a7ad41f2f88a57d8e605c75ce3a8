Gor Mahia assistant coach Sammy ‘ Pamzo’ Omollo wants a win and nothing less when K’Ogalo tackle last season’s runners-up KCB in the opening match of the season. According to Pamzo, the new players in the squad have already settled and are keen to start on high, challenging for the title they lost to Tusker FC last season after winning it for four times in a row. Last season, KCB collected four points from Gor with a first leg win and a draw in the second leg. ‘’We have had two weeks of proper preparation and our target is to win our first match. They beat us in the first leg last season and shared spoils with us in the second leg but this is time round they should expect a different show from us. It’s a new season and our objectives must reflect in how we start,” said Pamzo. The match will be played at Thika Stadium where Gor lost to champions Tusker FC on Wednesday in post-match penalties, in the FKF Super Cup. KÓgalo will however be without South Sudanese striker Tito Okello who is yet to report to camp without any formal communication. Also Read: ‘’He is still our players. He has a running contract and we expect him back anytime. I don’t really know why he has not reported back.’’ Another player likely to miss the Saturday action is winger Clifton Miheso who has reportedly not penned a new deal with K’Ogalo demanding for better terms. Gor Mahia are buoyed by the signing of seven new players unveiled last weekend after FIFA lifted their transfer ban. They include Kariobangi Sharks trio of Joshua Onyango, Peter Oudu and Peter Lwasa; Sando Yangayay from DRC who previously featured for Aguila, Malian shot-stopper Adama Keita from Indastriel de Kamsar of Guinea, and Wazito duo of Dennis Ngángá and Boniface Omondi. KCB, coached by former Gor and Harambee Stars coach Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno had a successful campaign last season, Tusker edging them with only three points to the title.
