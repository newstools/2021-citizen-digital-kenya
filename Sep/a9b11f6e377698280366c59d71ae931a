The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has interdicted Nakuru Boys High school Principal Mike Yator over allegations of charging extra fees to students between 2020 and 2021. In a letter dated September 1, 2021 signed by the Nakuru County TSC director Fredrick Ng’ang’a, the school principal is accused of contravening section 29 of the Basic Education Act by charging extra fees. The letter further states that Yator, who has served as Nakuru Boys Principal for the last five years, has 21 days to defend himself before the commission. The principal is also required to report to the nearest TSC sub-county office once a month, present evidence in support of the case, vacate office and forfeit his annual leave. The move coming at a time when Education Cabinet Secretary Professor George Magoha warned school heads against increasing fees for students.
