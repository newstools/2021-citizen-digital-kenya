AFC Leopards have announced they are planning to strengthen their squad by signing at least five new players to fill up the void left by key departures from their den. Elvis Rupia, Hansel Ochieng, Harrison Mwendwa, Collins Shichenje, Benjamin Ochan and Robinson Kamura are some of the players that have left the club and a couple more incluhave their contracts running out. Assistant coach Tom Juma says their pre-season preparations are going on smoothly after a short close season break. “There are players we are monitoring and ready to sign and that we shall do it at the right time. We have lost a big number of players hence plans are there to fill the gaps of at least five to six,” Juma stated. The former Leopards player added they will recall defensive midfielder Dan Musamali from loan at Nzoia Sugar. Meanwhile, the club’s treasurer Maurice Chichi has assured that they are committed to paying former coach Casa Mbungo his salary arrears as they negotiate on clearing a number of former players so that FIFA may allow them to make new signings.

Mbungo and other former players from Rwanda took Leopards to FIFA to force them clear their salary arrears with the world governing body slapping Ingwe with a ban to sign players until they clear the debts close to Sh12m.
