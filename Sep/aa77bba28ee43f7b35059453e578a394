Male adults and those in employment are the leading borrowers of funds from the more than 40 digital lenders operating in Kenya today. In the survey dubbed the State of Digital lending in Kenya Report 2021, released by  reel analytics, those surveyed also noted that they preferred digital lenders to conventional ones due to ease of processing despite the high interest rates they charge. The survey which targeted one thousand Kenyans across eight counties also shows Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru having the most active users with at least 57 percent seeking digital credit from time to time. The results of the survey comes only days after new fillings showed that Kenyans borrowed an estimated 1.2 billion shillings daily from Safaricom’s overdraft facility Fuliza.
