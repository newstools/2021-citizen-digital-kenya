Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka will be out of action for three months due to a knee injury sustained in Sunday’s victory against Tottenham Hotspur. Arsenal said the Switzerland captain, 29, has a “significant injury” to his medial knee ligament. Xhaka was replaced after 82 minutes in the 3-1 win at Emirates Stadium. An Arsenal statement said: “A specialist consultation took place on Tuesday evening which has determined that Granit does not require surgery.” Xhaka has started four of Arsenal’s six Premier League matches this season, with the two he missed part of his three-game suspension following a red card against Manchester City on 28 August. He was in Mikel Arteta’s side as the Gunners continued their recent revival against north London rivals Spurs but was caught by Tottenham forward Lucas Moura late on and limped from the field.
