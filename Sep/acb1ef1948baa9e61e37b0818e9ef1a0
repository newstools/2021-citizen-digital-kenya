Kenya received the first consignment of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine on Friday, purchased by the government to bolster inoculation efforts. The consignment of 141, doses of the vaccines touched down aboard a Lufthansa Flight some minutes before 9p.m. Speaking to the media from the JKIA on Friday while receiving the consignment, Health Ministry CAS Dr Mercy Mwangangi said the delivery marks a milestone in the country. The batch was from 13.3 million doses that Kenya has procured through the Africa Vaccines Acquisition Trust that was set up in November 2020. Although the government maintains that all the vaccines are equally effective, priority will be given to the Johnson and Johnson which is easier to store and requires less logistical and operational costs. Dr. Mwangangi urged Kenyans to get vaccinated, especially with the government’s plan to vaccinate at least 10 million adults by December.

Head of vaccine task force Dr Willis Akwale said Kenya is now administering 78,000 doses a day and plans to push it to 80,000 vaccines a day by end of September. “We distributed Moderna early this week, you might notice that it is slow because we are training medics on how to vaccinate with Moderna, Dr Akhwale said.
