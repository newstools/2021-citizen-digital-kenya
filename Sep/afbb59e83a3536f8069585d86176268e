Operations at the Wajir County headquarters were paralyzed on Wednesday as county offices remained locked with the entire county staff barred from entry. Police erected barricades at the entry of the county offices a day after ousted governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud stormed the county officers and forced his way into the governor’s office claiming to be the legitimate holder of the position. The County headquarters, which houses all county departments remained locked. It was not clear which court orders the ousted Governor was using in executing his return, as the orders issued from Meru law courts read in part: “We have equally read our directions given on 9th June 2021 when we declined to issue any fresh orders in the file on top of orders previously issued pending determination of the petition. We reiterate those orders and underscore the need to fast track the petition towards determination.” The power struggle between the ousted and the current governor is likely to affect the preparations for the swearing in of Muktar’s deputy governor, an event which was scheduled to take place Thursday.
