 National Super League side Shabana have suffered a massive blow in their preparations for next season after club captain Maurice Dukully and Mohammed Coulibally became the latest to ditch the Gusii stadium-based side. Others who have ditched the outfit for the newly promoted FKF-PL side Talanta are custodian Elix Otieno and the midfielder John Musyoka. Shabana,  despite an early promise, failed to nail a promotion berth to the top division, buckling under pressure, in the second leg, and the failure to attain this dream is seemingly having a ripple-effect on the squad. And speaking with Citizen Digital,  club head coach Robert Ojienda confirmed the exit, while rallying the management to put in place measures of ensuring the team does not disintegrate but stick together if they are to attain the cherished dream. “I’m proud that we had players whose impressive exploits attracted attention from clubs in the premier league,” he said. “That means we are doing a good job and should focus on making the most of the talents that we have in our ranks.” Also Read: “In as much as their departure is a big blow to our prospects, I have confidence in our ability to replace them with a blend of youth and experience that will help us get promoted next season. “We should move quickly to replace them so that we can then focus on other important things like the style of play, formations, and other related technical aspects,” he added. Touted as potential candidates for promotion up until mid-season in the 2020-21 campaign, Shabana flattered to deceive as their campaign imploded in the second leg leading to a disappointing eighth-place finish on 51 points, and have their work cut out if they are to challenge for the title next season.
