Three people have been confirmed dead and six others injured after a two-storey building collapsed in Mamboleo area, Kisumu County, on Monday. The bodies of the deceased have since been taken to the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching & Referral Hospital (JOOTRH). The injured are being treated at the same hospital where they are in stable condition. Several people were feared trapped after the building collapsed, with Kenya Red Cross and Kisumu County fire fighters leading rescue efforts. Eye witnesses said workers were on site when the building came down but most of them managed to get away. They told Citizen Digital that the building had visible cracks on it, hence it was just a matter of time before it came down.
