Former Kenyan international Boniface Ambani has backed Elvis Rupia’s move to Saudi Arabian side Bisha FC following an outstanding season in the FKF Premier League with AFC Leopards. Rupia was a key driving force in Leopards’ title challenge that ultimately fell short with the striker finishing the season with 17 league goals, seven behind the golden boot winner Eric Kapaito. He left Leopards for free as his contract had already run out, and Ambani believes the move is wise for financial reasons and might open more doors of opportunity for the 26-year-old. “As long as a player gets greener pastures anywhere it doesn’t matter. We have scouts who are doing a commendable job and according to me it does not matter which country one goes to or which type of club. What is important is you get enough playtime and have the things you want in life,” Ambani said. The former Leopards star added Kenyan players must not always wait for English Premier League clubs and other top European leagues to come for them if they have offers elsewhere provided they will better their lives. Rupia flew out of the country to Libya immediately after Leopards last match against Kakamega Homeboyz last month before he was reported to have entered into a deal with the Saudi Arabian second tier side. “So long as you get a club that’s the best and most important thing. He (Rupia) was here and unfortunately Ingwe did not manage to renew his contract. He could have just sat down and waited but to fly outside and try to get a club that will give him another platform to shine,” Ambani added. A number of players who have joined the long list of professionals are Michael Olunga, Victor Wanyama, Eric Ouma, David Owino, Duncan Otieno just to name a few who are plying their trade outside the country.
