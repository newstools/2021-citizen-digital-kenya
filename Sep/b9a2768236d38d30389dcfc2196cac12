Shock has engulfed Bochura village in Kisii country after a middle-aged man killed his two children before committing suicide on Saturday. The incident was confirmed by the area chief, Lawrence Omari who said the 44-year-old Daniel Mosota hacked his two children aged 5 and 7 with a panga. He had reportedly quarrelled with his wife Naomi Nyaboke prior to the incident. According to the chief, his wife managed to flee to safety during the savage attack. The area chief appealed to couples or families that may be going through a rough patch to seek help from professionals or local church leaders instead of killing themselves or others. Police officers from the Nyanchwa police station visited the crime scene and removed the bodies of the three to the Kisii County Refferal Hospital mortuary.
