Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has given the clearest indication yet that she is considering joining the Deputy President William Ruto-led United Democratic Alliance (UDA) to seek re-election under the party’s ticket. Waiguru made the suggestion on Wednesday while addressing members of public at Thiba area in Mwea Constituency. The Governor asked the crowd whether they would re-elect her as Governor of Kirinyaga County and they responded on the affirmative. She went ahead to ask them twice on which ticket she should seek re-election and they chanted UDA. While she did not categorically state that she would join UDA, Waiguru indicated she would make the decision depending on the party’s popularity in the area. “Mtanirusidha 2022 kama governor wa Kirinyaga?… Mliskia nikisema mimi naskiza watu wa Kirinyaga? Nilisema nitafanya vile watu wa Kirinyaga wanasema. Kwa sababu mumesema mutanirudisha, mnataka nikuje na chama gani huku Kirinyaga? Nikuje na chama gani? posed Waiguru as the crowd chanted UDA.
