Former Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario and former National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) Stephen Soi have been convicted of corruption and abuse of office over the Rio 2016 Olympic Games financial scandal. The court while convicting Wario said that indeed he took advantage of his office and had three other persons travel and be included in the team Kenya and have allowances issued to them. According to the court, this move by Wario resulted to loss of public funds. “The additional names were included after they closed the accreditation… Clearly this was an indicator that the three were not part of the team Kenya ..,”ruled the court. Magistrate Elizabeth Juma further noted that Wario did not have the mandate to allow the three travel to Rio. The three include Monica Sairo, Richard Abura and Edan Adow. The magistrate noted that there was wastage of resources adding that the budget for the games needs to be tailored. She directed that not everyone involved in the planning should travel.
