Kenya Police FC team manager George Maelo is banking on the experience of their head coach John ‘Bobby’ Ogolla to actualize their bid of securing a FKF Premier League place when they face Vihiga United in the playoffs. The two teams will face off on Sunday at the Mumias Sports Complex in the first leg of the final top flight place race with the replay set after a week at the Ruaraka Grounds in Nairobi. Maelo believes Ogolla’s experience in the Premier League will be vital during the two-legged playoffs. “He is a football legend in this country he commands respect wherever he goes he wants to win and we believe his experience will be crucial for us heading in to that playoff ,”said Maelo. Police finished third in the just concluded National Super League (NSL) while Vihiga United finished 14th in the top tier league, and the former Sofapaka FC defender says playing the second leg at home will be a huge boost to their morale. “Our fans and bosses will want to see us getting promoted to the league and playing the second leg at home will be an advantage to us but the most important thing is to get a win on Sunday which will ease pressure on us in the second leg at home,” added Maelo.
