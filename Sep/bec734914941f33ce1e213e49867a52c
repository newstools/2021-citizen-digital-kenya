The Kenya U-20 Women’s national team Rising Starlets is scheduled to face Uganda in the second round of the 2022 FIFA U20 Women World Cup Qualifiers next month. The first leg is slated for September 25 at 3:00pm at Nyayo National Stadium with the return leg set for October 8, in Uganda. Preparations for the two-legged knockout qualifier started off with a selection exercise on September 15, under the tutelage of Harambee Starlets coach Charles Okere who has since trimmed the squad in camp to 30 players. “We begin our FIFA U20 Women World Cup campaign against Uganda this Saturday, and we are determined to get a positive result that will take us a step closer to our dream of featuring in the 2022 FIFA U20 Women World Cup,” said Rising Starlets head coach Okere. “This level is crucial for us because we get to train and nurture the next generation of players that will transit to the Senior Starlets,” he continued. Uganda’s Crested Cranes is set to arrive in the country on Thursday, September 23, 2021 morning.
