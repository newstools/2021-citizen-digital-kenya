Claimants of Blue Shield Insurance Company Limited can now hope for compensation as the courts sets a hearing date for a petition to wind up the troubled underwriter. High Court’s Commercial and Admiralty Division has set November 25 as the start date for the hearing of the petition. Stakeholders in the underwitter opposed or in support of drilling down the final nail in the coffin of the insurer are expected to be enjoined in the petition by the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) when the hearing commences. The compensation of claimants in Blue Shield is expected to only start after the conclusion of the wind up petition. This as the underwriter was placed under the statutory management of the Policyholders Compensation Fund (PCF) before a law change allowing compensation before liquidation which blocked any payouts to policy holders. United Insurance is another troubled underwriter but in which policyholders await its dissolution before receiving compensation.

An array of challenges including counter petitions have until now stopped the insurance regulator- the IRA from liquidating both companies. Blue Shield Insurance Company Limited was placed under receivership in September of 2011 and has Ksh.2.2 billion in estimated claims by policyholders. Established in 1982, the underwriter had its operations base in life and health insurance. Video Of The Day: Former sports CS Hassan Wario convicted over Rio games scam
