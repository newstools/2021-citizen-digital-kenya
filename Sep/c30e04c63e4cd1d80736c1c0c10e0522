Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji has come out to rubbish claims that he failed to charge key suspects in the murder of Tob Cohen. In a statement sent to newsrooms on Monday, the DPP maintained that there was no sufficient evidence to prefer charges against the suspects. “In respect of investigations into the involvement of Honourable Justice Sankale Ole Kantai, upon a thorough perusal of the inquiry file and analysis of the evidence, the ODPP was satisfied that, there was no sufficient evidence at that time to prefer charges against the said suspect unless additional evidence was made available to warrant a review of the said decision,” said the DPP “This decision was communicated to the DCI.” However, in respect of the investigations into the involvement of Ms. Sarah Wairimu Kamotho and Peter Njoroge Karanja, the ODPP was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to charge the two suspects with the murder of Tob Cohen. The criminal case is pending hearing before the High Court.

The officer alleges that the judge convened several meetings with Sarah Wairimu to plan to murder Cohen at different places, location and dates.
