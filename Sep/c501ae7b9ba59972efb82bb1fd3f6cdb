The largest drop in number of unionisable employees was registered in the wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor-vehicle and motorcycles category with the number of covered employees collapsing to 60 from 20,267. Other categories to mark the significant downturn in unionised workers include agriculture (2,958), transport and storage (888), human health and social work activities (14) and construction (81).
