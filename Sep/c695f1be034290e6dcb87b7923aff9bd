Kenya and the UK government are working to process vaccine certificates recognisable by both countries. In a joint statement, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe and British High Commissioner to Kenya Jane Marriott said the document will make travel smooth for citizens of bothn countries. The move follows growing public concern about the issue of vaccine certification. “We want to make it clear that both the UK and Kenya recognize vaccines administered in both countries: Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson. It is false to state that vaccines administered in either country are unapproved,” reads part of the statement. Currently, neither Kenya nor the UK has completed the process of recognizing the other country’s vaccine certification. Meanwhile, Kenya has been struck off the UK’s red list.
