Undercover detectives have arrested three primary suspects, one of whom is a preacher, in a series of robberies that have rocked Nambale Town in Busia. Paraphernalia linked to the crime has also been recovered. The suspects were arrested during a four-day sting operation, according to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), which was intended to nip the town’s rising crime. “Maviala Shisanya, 34, Xavior Ojuma, 32 and the man of the cloth Nicholas Mabiala 32, were arrested 2 days ago in Bungoma town and whisked to Nambale Police station for further interrogation,” the DCI said. The two suspects led police to a hideout on Thursday, where police recovered a slew of stolen items. “The goods included music systems, gas cylinders, mobile phones among other valuables suspected to have been stolen,” the detectives added. A 24-year-old woman was also arrested after she was found with a 6-kg gas cylinder and a stolen music system. “The suspects are currently being processed to face robbery with violence charges,” the detectives said in a statement on Friday. Still in Nambale, a 22-year-old man was stoned to death on suspicion of stealing on Thursday. Collins Omieno, 22, died after failing to verify ownership of a chicken and five chicks he was carrying,  hidden in a gunny bag, according to the DCI. As the crowd listened to his story, word arrived that a similar hen and five chicks had vanished from a nearby shopping center. “When Omieno learnt that he had been cornered, he took to his heels as the angry mob chased after him baying for his blood. He ran for dear life for about two kilometres,but the mob pursuing him was unrelenting!” a police report seen by Citizen Digital explains. He was cornered by the mob around the Ginnery grounds and beaten to death. The police have urged Kenyans to avoid taking matters into their own hands, and instead, report incidences to the police for action.
