Kariobangi Sharks striker Eric Kapaito is the Most Valuable Player of the Football Kenya Federation League (FKF-PL) for the 2020/2021 season. Kapaito, who also took home the Golden Boot award having scored 24 goals in the season, beat Tusker’s Eugene Asike, Lawrence Juma, James Saruni, Henry Meja and Elvis Rupia to the coveted award, after a stellar season with Sharks. This is Kapaito’s second MVP award, having won the gong in the 2018 season when he also won the Golden Boot. “I want to encourage the players who are playing in the grassroots, the upcoming ones who are not known. It is possible, they can trust the process,” Kapaito said shortly after receiving the award, which came with Sh1 million plus the Sh 500,000 he pocketed for the Golden Boot, going home Sh1.5 million richer.  Tusker FC dazzled the most at the  gala, taking five of the 12 awards, with Robert Matano winning the Coach of the Year award, Henry Meja the Young Player of the Year while Eugene Asike scooped the Defender of the Year award.

Her only daughter was present to receive the award. In his speech during the gala, FKF President Nick Mwendwa noted it took concerted efforts to successfully conclude the season under unprecedented circumstances orchestrated by Covid-19. “I thank the players, the officials and all stakeholders for working together to ensure we made it despite all the challenges. We especially had the challenge of playing venues, and we had to improvise the Utalii Grounds, Ruaraka and Thika Stadium as Nyayo Stadium and Kasarani were unavailable. We pray one day we can have all clubs with own stadium, and it’s a dream to work for,” noted Mwendwa. Mwendwa also regretted that the title sponsor had to pull out towards the tail end of the season, revealing the federation is in the process of bringing on board another one.
