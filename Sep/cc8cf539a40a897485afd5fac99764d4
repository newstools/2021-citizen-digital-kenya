Bandari FC new catch Whyvonne Isuza has attributed their strong start to the league to the ‘good’ pre-season the team had. The dockers got off to a roaring start beating Mathare United 3-0 at their Mbaraki backyard on Saturday. Bandari had camped in Ngong, Kajiado County before another week at their Mombasa base playing three friendlies in the course. “We had good preparations and the bonding in the camp played a big role in our wonderful start of the season,” said soft-spoken Isuza. At the same time the former Wazito and AFC Leopards attacking midfielder says that having worked under Andre Casa Mbungo at Leopards, he knows exactly what the coach needs of him. “We have worked with Casa before and I know what he expects from me that’s why it was easy for me to adopt,” he explained.
