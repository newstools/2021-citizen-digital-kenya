One person was seriously injured  after chaos broke out at the Kenya Assemblies of God (KAG ) Sagana Church in Kirinyaga County on Sunday. The scuffle erupted as Bishop Ben Irungu of the Mount Kenya region was wrapping up a ceremony in which congregants demanded to know who would be their pastor.’ “Bishop before you conclude the service we are aware today is a big day for us because you are ordaining our new pastor because our pastor Rev.William  Wachira died in March this year,” a church member identified as Francis Gachau. The congregation backed Reverend Esther Wachira, whom they hoped to succeed her late husband as pastor. “Huyu mama alianza kanisa na bwana yake, sasa wakati Kanis imesimama wanataka kupatia mtu mwingine, hatutakubali,” a section of worshippers said. They accused Bishop Ben Irungu, who was officiating the service, of favoring Pastor Nahashon Maina, who was close to the late pastor at the time. “We prayed for 21 days and settled for Rev,Esther Wachira. Right now they want to ordain Pastor maina ,we won’t allow this,” the church deacon said. A scuffle then erupted in church which degenerated into chaos. In the aftermath, they discovered that one of the deacons, only identified as Gachau was bleeding. While adressing the media, Gachau accused pastor Maina of hitting him in the head with a microphone, injuring him. “Pastor Maina ndiye amenigonga, mimi nilikuwa nasimama kuuliza swali akaniumiza, hata kama nitauawa, sisi tunataka pastor Esther Wachira,” he said. Police officers from Sagana police station arrived  at the church  and calmed the situation before closing the church. ‘ We will summon church leadership  to explain to us what chaos was about,’ a Senior police officer said.
