Police in Nyatike, Migori County have been put in spot for undermining the fight against child abuse in the sub county. Nyatike sub county children Officer Joyce Atieno said there are many police officers who declined to respond to cases of child abuse while others have interfered with the cases reported to them by the children department. Atieno said there are several cases of defilement which include a case involving a teacher in Muhuru ward which have not been pursued to conclusion because the police officers who are supposed to handle the cases are not cooperative. She said the children’s department has been pursuing the cases involving a teacher accused of defiling her pupils in Muhuru ward for the past two months and to date the teacher is still walking scot free. Ms. Atieno said the children department has reported the cases to the Teachers Service Commission officers at the grassroot level but still they are not sure if the pupils defiled by the head teacher will get justice. Atieno said there are senior police officers in the region who have been working closely with the suspects to interfere with the cases.
