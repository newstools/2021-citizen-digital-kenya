Equity Bank head coach David Maina has lauded the women’s team for finishing the first leg of the season unbeaten. Maina says attaining the feat was no mean task adding that the goal is to defend the crown when the second leg gets underway. “It is not easy to win all the games without losing any and we want to maintain the performance in the second leg so that by the end of the regular season we are the top team which will give us advantage in the playoffs,” Maina said. Maina has at the same time rallied his charges not to rest on their laurels as the hard part awaits them in the second leg. “We will continue pushing towards maintaining the good performance and letting the players know that the second leg and playoffs is the hardest part and therefore we need to be more focused and do things right,” he said. At the weekend Maina’s girls were in fine form beating Eagle Wings 65-26 and ANU 54-30 to take their points tally to 22 from 11 matches.
