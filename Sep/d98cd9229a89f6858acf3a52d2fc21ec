Elvis Rupia has reportedly joined an unnamed Libya football club, AFC Treasurer Maurice Chichi has said. According to Chichi, Ingwe will not receive any coin from Rupia’s new employers since his contract with the 12-time champions had run out. “His contract had expired when he left the country for Libya and therefore, technically, the club will not be getting anything. He went on: “We even don’t know the details of his whereabouts because he just flew out to Libya and I don’t think he went for trials but a substantive signing with his new employers,” Chichi revealed to Citizen Digital. Rupia finished second on the top scorers charts in the FKF Premier League, netting 17 goals and Leopards will have to plan for life without him ahead of the new term. “I have not spoken to him and the last time I checked he had flown to Libya for something like trials. I have not communicated with him to know how it went and so I don’t know if he returned or still in Libya,” Leopards assistant coach Tom Juma said.

Leopards resumed their pre-season Monday with Juma confirming that all their players who were expected in training showed up. Meanwhile Clyde Senaji, Harrison Mwendwa, Hansel Ochieng, Collins Shichenje and Robinson Kamura have all parted ways with the club.
