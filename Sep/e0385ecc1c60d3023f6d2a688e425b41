Despite registering a win over the weekend, Eldonets head coach Maurice Ouma says they faced a tough opposition in Lakeside and the victory should not be seen as ‘a walk in the park’. “It was a tough match but we managed and the win boosted us. We had confidence even though Lakeside were a good side too,” Ouma said. The win hauled Eldonets points tally to 13 as the contest for men’s basketball league honours gathers pace. Meanwhile, it was also a bumper weekend for students Strathmore Blades who beat Umoja and KCA University 63-50 and 53- 40 respectively and head coach Tony Ochieng could not hide his delight. “It means a lot to me because we have been out of action for about two months without playing. The win has also improved our ranking and also given us some elements to work on before our next match,” Ochieng said. Blades have now moved up to position seven with 14 points after nine games, winning five and losing four while Umoja are fourth with 18 points.
