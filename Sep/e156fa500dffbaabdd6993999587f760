World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge has officially launched his foundation- Eliud Kipchoge Foundation- with focus on education and environment. The two-time Olympic champion said the goal of the foundation is to give more children access to education as well as help conserve the environment especially through planting of trees. “I’m very grateful to launch my Eliud Kipchoge Foundation today. My mission is to give all children in the world access to knowledge and education. I want those children to grow up into healthy adults in a green and breathing world where forests keep our people safe,” Kipchoge posted on his official twitter handle. Kipchoge has been at the forefront in promoting environmental conservation, having adopted some 50 hectares in Kaptagat Forest last year. “As a farmer myself, I know about the importance of a good environment, of trees, of using the land in a sustainable way, so people can grow healthy food and plants, also for the next generations…You can always start helping, even by adopting trees. I began already with adopting a forest near our training camp to help save it. I want to reach out to help save and grow forests around the world,” Kipchoge said. The Foundation also welcomes donations from well wishers in a boost to raise more funds to enable children access education through sponsoring school fees and even building of libraries.
