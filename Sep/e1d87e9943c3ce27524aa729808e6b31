The main suspect behind the  murder of four men, in Kitengela ,Kajiado county, has been arraigned at the   Kajiado High Court . Benson Melonyie OLe Mungai, (40) appeared before Judge Chacha Mwita. The suspect pleaded not guilty to murder charges. The suspect had been arrested after Fredrick Mureithi Wanjiru(30), Victor Mwangi Wanjiru(25), Mike George Ondusso(29) and Nicholus Kyengo Musa(28) met their death , 15 kilometers from Kitengela town at Enkamuriaki village. They were reportedly lynched by villagers who accused them of plotting to steal their livestock. The suspects will be remanded  at the Athi River Prisons until October 1 2021 when  the court will rule on his application for bail. The suspect was arrested a few days after DCI took over investigations into the murders and moved with speed to pursue the killers. “Ole Mungai was positively linked into the brutal killings after forensic investigations placed him at the scene of the crime where it was established that he led and coordinated the killing of the four.” A statement from the DCI said. On the fateful day between noon and 9pm, the four  were reportedly on an after party motor racing between Kitengela and Isinya in Kajiado when one motor cycle broke down. It is while trying to repair the motor bike that they were attacked by local herdsmen who accused them of plotting to steal their livestock; all the four were killed on the spot.
