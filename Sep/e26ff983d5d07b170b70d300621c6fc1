A 42-year-old fisherman from Wadiang’a beach in Suba South constituency, Homa Bay County died after he drowned in Lake Victoria on Monday evening. The fisherman identified as Daniel Ochieng Okumu met his death while on a normal fishing expedition in Lake Victoria together with three of his colleagues. Suba Sub county beach management unit chairperson William Onditi explained that Okumu lost balance while inside the boat and drowned due to heavy winds that prevailed in the lake last evening as they were carrying out their routine fishing. Onditi says that the fishermen’s boat engine developed mechanical breakdown and stopped working and in the process, the deceased walked towards the engine to restart it but he accidentally slipped from the boat and fell into the waters. Efforts by the other fishermen to save their colleague were futile. The body of the deceased is yet to be retrieved from the lake.
