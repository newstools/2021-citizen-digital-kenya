The first batch of players and officials left Nairobi early this morning for Djibouti ahead of Sunday’s CAF Champions League preliminary round tie against Arta Solar 7. The team is travelling in two groups, with the second batch expected to depart later Wednesday. The full travelling party includes 19 players, six technical bench members and four officials. Coach Robert Matano is confident his charges will deliver a win come Sunday. “We are not taking it for granted it’s a very tough game but those are the good challenges for teams like Tusker FC and myself as a coach we are well prepared and ready for the task ahead,” Matano said. Matano’s sentiments were echoed by captain Eigine Asike who insisted on the importance of getting the away win. “The mood in the camp is so positive we have new players coming in and that will boost our confidence. The players are prepared and determined to make the country and our fans proud. It’s always good to get a good result away we know they have experienced players but we have studied the team and we have a plan to handle them,” Asike stated. The second leg will be played in Nairobi on the 18th of this month with the winner facing Egyptian giants Zamalek in the first round with the first leg set for October 15-17 and the second leg between October 22-24. “They are a good team that should not be undermined but also it’s important not to fear them. They have players who have played in different leagues around the world but that doesn’t mean that we are worried about them. we have seen most of their players in action and they advantage is they haven’t seen us in action so we going there to get a win ,”the veteran tactician told the media while departing for Djibouti.
