After being caught up in a showbiz whirlwind following her unexpected run to the U.S. Open final, Canadian teenager Leylah Fernandez said she now feels like Cinderella. The 19-year-old, along with U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu, is being hailed the world over after her electrifying run in Flushing Meadows. Following an intense fortnight, Fernandez let her hair down as she rubbed shoulders with some A-list celebrities at the Met Gala in New York as well as appearing on chat shows. She has also signed new sponsorship deals. “It kind of felt like I was Cinderella,” she said of the Met Gala event while sitting alongside fellow Canadian tennis player Felix Auger Aliassime. “Everything’s coming in so fast.” Even though her profile has now reached new heights, there are some things that Canadian does not plan to change – such as her father Jorge staying on as her main coach.
