The East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) member Dr. Oburu Oginga has said his brother and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga is not waiting for endorsement from anybody in his quest to lead the country. He said Mr. Odinga is in the struggle to ascend to the top leadership of Kenya, adding that he is not expecting to be given the top seat in a silver platter. Dr. Oburu stated that Mr. Odinga is fighting for the presidency like any other contender, therefore laughing off claims by their political opponents that the former premier is expecting favors form certain quarters. “What I want to say here is that we’re in a struggle, we’re not expecting to be given leadership on a silver platter. Raila is fighting for the presidency like any other, so those who are campaigning should campaign very peacefully, but they should know that all along they have been collaborators with oppressors in this country,” he said. He spoke during the celebration of the anniversary of former Ugenya MP Archbishop Stephen Ondiek in Ugenya constituency, where he seemingly dismissed Deputy President William Ruto’s camping strategy. “Somebody who was a witch comes to you here and starts preaching as if now he is a bishop. How do you turn yourself from running at night bewitching people and then you say you’re now a bishop? People of Kenya are not stupid, they know who has been consistent in fighting for the interests of Kenya and who has been in the system,” he stated.
