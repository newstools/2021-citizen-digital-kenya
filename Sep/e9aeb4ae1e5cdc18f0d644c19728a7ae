Vihiga Queens are on the verge of acquiring six new players to boost their depth and quality ahead of the the inaugural CAF Women’s Champions League scheduled for November 5-19 in Cairo, Egypt. Vihiga Queens edged Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) 2-1 in the CAF Women’s Champions League CECAFA qualifiers’ final at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani on Thursday last week to qualify. The club’s Boniface Nyamunyamu has said the six new faces include three locals and the other three are foreigners. “We’ll sign one goalkeeper, two defenders, two midfielders and a striker in our road to Cairo. Early this week I submitted their names to the club bosses for negotiations and I’m sure by next week all will be settled so that they can hit the training ground as early as possible,” he said. He appreciated the Sh500,000 cash token from the ODM leader Raila Odinga awarded to the team on Sunday, saying it will motivate his players to work hard “Our former Prime Minister has also promised to meet the team before our departure to North Africa and he requested for our full budget for a possible sponsorship. This is a huge motivation to my girls and the team at large and that’s why I am urging other stakeholders to come on board and boost our team.” Also Read: Club officials are due to meet with representatives from sponsors Vihiga County Government on Wednesday over talks for facilitation to train at a better facility away from the current Kidundu Stadium whose state is below the desired standard. “We are supposed to kick off our training on Thursday and we can’t rely on Kidundu Stadium due to its bad state. We are used to training in the morning hours because of tight schedule in the stadium and whenever it rains like yesterday, everything comes to a standstill,” Nyamunyamu said.
