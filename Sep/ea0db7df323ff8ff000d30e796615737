After a one week boot camp in the Coast region, Tusker FC head coach Robert Matano is optimistic that his squad is ready for the CAF Champions League assignment against Djibouti’s Arta Solar 7 in the preliminary rounds. At the same time the experienced tactician says the boot camp has helped the team gel, offering the new recruits a chance to get accustomed to their colleagues. “We have achieved most of our targets in Mombasa; that is bonding and also to give the new players time to learn our way of play ahead of the Champions League,” Matano offered, noting that,  “We are ready and we will take each match at a time with all our abilities and make sure we represent the country well.” The Football Kenya Federation Premier League champions will begin their campaign away in Djibouti this weekend before a return match in a week’s time with the aggregate winner facing Egyptian giants Zamalek in the next round. The brewers camped in Mombasa due to its weather which has similar atmospheric conditions with Djibouti where their first leg match will be held. In Mombasa, the 12-time champions played two friendly matches against FC Shells and Mvita Youngsters losing 3-2 and winning 5-0 respectively.
