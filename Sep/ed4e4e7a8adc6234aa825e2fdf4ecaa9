The national women’s volleyball team slumped to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Cameroon as their quest for a tenth Africa Nations Championships title began in underwhelming fashion at the Kigali Arena here in the Rwandan capital. The defending champions put on a solid show against the Malkia Strikers, winning 25-20, 25-21 and 25-19 to lay down a huge marker for their chances of retaining the African crown for a third successive year. The Kenyans were a pale shadow of the side that had not lost to the same opposition since 2019 with head coach Paul Bitok blaming the unforced errors, poor reception, service and inexperience as their biggest undoing. “I’ve introduced three new players in the squad and sometimes it’s difficult to match your opponents who are champions with a fresh starting line up. Cameroon had energy, a self-belief and a collective desire about the match and were spot on in almost all their departments. “Some of stars like Chepchumba (Sharon) and Moim (Mercy) were not hundred percent fit because they have just shaken off their injuries and that is why they were not attacking to their usual best,” he told Citizen Digital. Bitok also believes the absence of star setter Jane Wacu through injury cost his side dearly. Also Read: “We’ve missed Wacu and her absence has hurt us a lot, especially in the setter position. Luseneka (Joy) and Mutinda (Esther) have tried but Wacu is very experienced and having her in the team brings confidence because she is a key figure in volleyball.” Kenya will be out to right their wrongs when they face DRC Congo in the second pool ‘B’ match starting 12pm while Cameroon face tricky Tunisia starting 10am.
