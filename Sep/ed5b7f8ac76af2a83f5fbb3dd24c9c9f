Ulinzi Warriors head coach William Balozi is proud that his boys held their nerves to outclass their closest challengers in the men’s Basketball Premier League, Equity Bank at the Nyayo Stadium Gymnasium on Saturday. Balozi’s men won 86-58 to continue with their impressive run, having lost just a match this season while handing Equity their third defeat of the campaign. The win, which took Ulinzi’s tally to 27 points after playing 14 matches, was unique to Balozi in his quest to retain the title. “This is a very important win to us. It means a lot when you can push yourself and stop a team that is a title challenger. Everyone comes to us knowing we are the champions and so we really have to concentrate to keep our run,” said Balozi. Equity head coach Carrey Odhiambo conceded their rivals deserved the win, going by the quality they exhibited. “Ulinzi played a fantastic match. They made big shots and we have learned our lessons,” Odhiambo said. Also Read: Equity are still in the second position with 23 points having played 13 matches winning 10 and losing three.
