Andrew Amonde has warned his KCB teammates to be wary of the strong scrum technique employed by Kabras Sugar ahead of their Kenya Cup final at the Nandi Bears Club on Saturday. The venue has served as Kabras’ home ground this season and the hosts will look to capitalise on that advantage as they look to end KCB’s three-year hold of the country’s top-flight rugby title. The Bankers have defeated Kabras in each of the last four finals they have met, but the latter have the head to head advantage over the past two meetings having beaten them twice in the regular season. “We are very determined to win that match I know they have beaten us twice this season but it’s not about revenge but being at our best by minimizing mistake that can cost us points. In a final everything counts and we can’t afford to make mistake against a will drilled side like Kabras,” Amonde said. Kabras have won the previous two encounters this season but Amonde believes the past has nothing to do with the finals on Saturday and added that they have enough experience in the team that has played and won many finals compared to their opponents. “That team has a very strong scrum that can match any strong opponent they are completely a different side from the one we faced last year we know they have played in that field several times compared to us but as I said our aim is to win the fourth title in a row make our sponsors and fans proud,” Amonde added.
