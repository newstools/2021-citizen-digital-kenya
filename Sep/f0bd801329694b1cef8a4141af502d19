FKF Premier League August Player of the Month award winner Johanna Mwita has now set his sights on a national team call up as Harambee Stars bid to qualify for the 2022 World Cup Finals set for Doha,  Qatar. Mwita who was awarded the accolade at the team’s boot camp in Ngong, said that apart from scoring more goals for Bandari in the soon -to-begin season, it is every player’s dream to represent his country. “Like every player I want to be on top and wearing a Harambee Stars jersey and help my country acquire a World Cup ticket,” said joyful Mwita. The former Sony Sugar attacker scored four goals in August to fend off competition from Mathare United duo John Mwangi and Daniel Otieno as well as Vihiga United’s Lawrence Luvanda while his coach Andre Casa Mbungo scooped the coach of the month award. “Without my team mate, I could not make it and that is why I am saying it is our award and not mine alone.” Mwita kicked off the month on a high note, scoring in the 2-1 win over Tusker FC a result that almost derailed the brewers title hopes before adding another one in the next game away to Kakamega Homeboyz where the Dockers won 2-1.

On his side Rwandan tactician Mbungo claimed his second Coach of the Month award in the just concluded season after winning it back in February.    Mbungo is the only Bandari’s representative in tonight’s 2020/21 Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Premier League Awards Gala set to go down at the Safari Park Hotel. He will be up against Tusker’s Robert Matano, Kariobangi Sharks coach William Muluya, Frank Ouna who helped Mathare United to escape relegation and Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno of KCB.
