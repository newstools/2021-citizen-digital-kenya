Five coffee marketing firms have filed a petition to the National Assembly seeking to be admitted to the Nairobi Coffee Exchange. The five including United Eastern Coffee Marketing Limited, Meru County Coffee Marketing Agency, Kipkelion Brokerage Company, Mount Elgon Coffee Marketing Agency and Murang’a County Coffee Dealers Limited argue that the decision by the exchange to deny them access to trading is illegal. They further argue in the petition that the decision by the coffee exchange is not backed by any law and goes against the spirit of the farmer centric reforms in the sector championed by the Ministry of Agriculture. “On 19th August 2021 the United Eastern Kenya Coffee Marketing Company, a licensed coffee broker, sought admission to NCE auction floor by requesting allocation of lots range and brokers code. The NCE rejected their request citing Legal Notice 104 and the need to seek advisory opinion from the Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture. Notably, this Legal Notice has been revoked by the CS, Agriculture and cannot legally be used to deny licensed coffee growers access to the exchange to trade their coffee,” reads the petition. “There no policy or law that supports the NCE’s rejection to admit a duly licensed brokerage firm.” The petition was received by Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege. Also Read: “Why should we allow foreigners to trade and deny our own people to trade. And I think these are some of the things making the general public feel like this government does not care,” said Sabina Chege. Francis Ngine, Chairman National Coffee Federation added: “The top most activity was going to the Nairobi Coffee Exchange which we have not been able. We have through other areas including getting the marketing licenses through the Capital Markets Authority.” Video Of The Day: | CHASING HOPE | KEMRI undertaking stem cell research for treatment of Leishmaniasis
