Deputy President Wiliam Ruto has now stated that supporters of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) must avoid misleading the public by claiming that the Bill was the only way to increase revenue to the counties. Speaking at his Karen home on Thursday, when he fellowshipped with spiritual leaders from various churches and mosques from Makueni County. The DP said BBI proponents must forward their proposal on the additional resources to the devolved units of government to Parliament if they were true to the cause. “Counties can still be given more funds through Parliament without the conmanship in the BBI,” he said. Even the formation of new constituencies, according to DP Ruto, was possible without sending the country down the unnecessary and costly path of altering the Constitution. “If Kenyans were in need of more constituencies, then the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission would have been engaged.” The second-in -command went on to say it is time the country was spared the  reckless deceit from some leaders out to score political points after failing to sell BBI to Kenyans. At the same time, the 2022 political contender asserted that proponents of the BBI must apologize to Kenyans for sabotaging the Big Four agenda. “It would have created millions of jobs opportunities besides ensuring that all Kenyans have access to affordable medical care. But all these gains went down the drain because of the BBI,” he added. According to the DP, the BBI was “the biggest fraud and the most dangerous assignment” ever pursued in Kenya that would have destroyed its democratic ideals because of the establishment of an imperial president. “It must therefore fail, and die forever.” His allies, among them, the Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wah said the collapse of BBI was long overdue. “It never meant anything good to our country,” he said.
