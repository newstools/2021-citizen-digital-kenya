Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiangi has directed all the Regional Commissioners and County Commissioners to fire all chiefs and their Assistants who will be found guilty of abetting illicit alcoholic drinks and substances within their areas of jurisdiction. Matiangi said that  part of the illicit problem at the grass-root areas is supported by the administrators who at times receive bribes from the sellers. The tough-speaking CS said action must be taken going forward to tame the growing vice that has seen many people lose their lives. The CS who was speaking during the launch of Rapid Response Initiative on illicit alcoholic drinks and substances also pointed an accusing finger at county governments over the increase of the vice by licensing sellers without following due process in pursuit of revenue. He said reports indicate that county governments have been issuing license to single houses to operate the business of selling cheap liquor to youth. His statement was echoed by his his PS Karanja Kibicho who said it is time to act.
