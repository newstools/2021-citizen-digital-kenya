The High Court will on Tuesday, September 28 rule on whether it will cancel the bond granted to Joseph Irungu alias Jowie, who is charged with the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. This follows an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) seeking to have Jowie’s bond cancelled for allegedly violating the conditions issued by the court. In documents filed in court, the DPP submits that in June this year Jowie was involved in a fight at club 1824 in Nairobi’s Lang’ata area and allegedly assaulted one Rodgers Okuga. According to the DPP, even though the case was withdrawn, Jowie committed an offence. Jowie is further accused of giving YouTube interviews where he has discussed the merits of the murder case contrary to directives issued by justice James Wakiaga when he granted him bond. An affidavit filed by the investigating officer also indicates that Jowie lives in Nairobi and not with his parents as he had told the court while asking to be released on bail pending hearing and determination of the case. It is for the above reasons that the prosecution wants the bail cancelled. Jowi was charged with the murder of Monica Kimani and pleaded not guilty. He was granted a cash bail of Ksh.2 million on February 13, 2020. Video Of The Day: Iconic city hotels staring at bleak future
