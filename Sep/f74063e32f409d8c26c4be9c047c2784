Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) seized 60 pellets of suspected heroin from a suspected drug trafficker on Tuesday in Kayole. According to a police report obtained by Citizen Digital, the suspect, Beatrice Awuor who works at the Mbagathi Hospital as a nurse was preparing to ingest the pellets in order to transport them to an unknown location. “Transnational organized crime detectives acting on information received via our #FichuakwaDCI hotline, stormed her house in Nasra area within Kayole and pounced on the 42-year-old trafficker,” the police report says. Detectives found three passports after checking her home: hers and two others belonging to Caroline Adongo Mujibi and Risper Auma Ochieng, who are suspected of being her accomplices. “Upon further scrutiny, the sleuths managed to identify one of the passports as that of a drug trafficker, who has an ongoing case in court,” the police report adds. A job identity card which was also recovered during the operation identified the mastermind- Ms Awuor as a nurse working at the Mbagathi Hospital.

Crime scene investigators from DCI-Kayole documented the scene, and the pellets  turned over to anti-narcotics experts from DCI headquarters for forensic analysis.
