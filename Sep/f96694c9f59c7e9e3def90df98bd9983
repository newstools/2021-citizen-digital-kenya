Allan Wetende Wanga has hinted at a possibility of contesting for the post of the FKF president in the next elections slated for October 2024. Wanga’s sentiments come barely two days after he officially announced his retirement from active football to bring to a halt a glorious 14 years of professional journey. The former AFC Leopards, Tusker, Sofapaka and Kakamega Homeboyz striker will in the meantime be focusing on his job as the sports officer in the Kakamega county government before aiming to unseat Nick Mwendwa. “After retiring I will now focus on the Kakamega county job that I have and then God willing I will try to contest for the FKF top seat so that I may bring change in the sport,” Wanga said. Wanga boasts of great achievements and is best remembered for his double goals at a muddy Nyayo Stadium that  arned Kenya the Cecafa senior Challenge title in 2013. “I have been a top scorer twice; I have won the FKF Cup with AFC Leopards and Sofapaka. Also Read: I have also won CECAFA with the national team (Harambee Stars) and so I just want to thank God for the 14 years he has been in the field,” Wanga added. In the run-up to the last FKF elections speculation was rife he Would gun for the seat but he never thrust his hat in the ring. The 35-year old has also featured for the likes of Petro Atletico of Angola, FC Baku of Azerbaijan, Hoang Anh Gia Lai of Vietnam, Sudanese giants El Merreikh and Azam FC of Tanzania. “I remember I met top players like Ronaldinho (Gaucho, the Brazilian retired professional footballer) in 2018 and also when I was in El Merreikh as we were in Qatar pre-season I met Van Der Sar (Edwin, the former Man United and Netherlands goalkeeper) and I felt very good,” Wanga underscored. His last assignment on the pitch was with Kakamega Homeboyz last term. Video Of The Day: People living with disability call for inclusion in vaccination drive
