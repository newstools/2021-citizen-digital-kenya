Nairobi City Stars assistant coach John Amboko is keen to learn from the new head coach Nickolas Muyoti, as the new FKF-PL season kicks off on Saturday. Amboko led the team until the end of the season after former coach Sanjin Alajic left the club but Muyoti who was in charge of Kakamega Homeboyz last season was quickly roped in to lead the bench. Although there was every sign that City Stars initially wanted Amboko to lead City Stars in the new season, the coming of the former Harambee Stars captain is a well calculated move.  “Muyoti has gained enough experience in the recent years at the Premier League and joining is a plus for the team. In this great project we are in here, I’m very keen to learn from him because he is one of the best young coaches in the country at the moment,” said Amboko. Having played together at AFC Leopards previously, Amboko hopes their camaraderie will be key in meeting the expectations of the management.
