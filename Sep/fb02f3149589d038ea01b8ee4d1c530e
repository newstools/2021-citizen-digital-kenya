Vihiga Queens assistant coach Boniface Nyamunyamu is optimistic his charges will beat Gaspo when both sides lock horns on Thursday at the Ruaraka Stadium in the first semi-final of the ongoing FKF Women Cup. The newly crowned Cecafa champions narrowly pipped league newbies Bunyore Starlets 1-0 in a tightly-contested FKF Women Cup tie last Sunday at Mumboha Stadium in Vihiga County to book their slot in the last four against Gaspo whom in their side thrashed Kayole Starlets 4-2 (penalties) after 1-1 draw in regular time. This will be a highly contested match considering that Gaspo overcome Vihiga 5-4 on penalties in the FKF Women Premier League playoff in June at the Nakuru showground. “I can say it will be a tough match because they defeated us in the playoffs but we will try our best to beat them. We have hard intensive training ahead of the match and the morale is high,” Nyamunyamu said. The second semi will pit Ulinzi Starlets against Kisumu All Starlets who beat Zetech and Wadadi in their last matches consecutively to sail through with both matches being played in Ruaraka. Vihiga will use the tournament as part of preparations ahead of the inaugural CAF Women’s Champions League scheduled for November 5-19 in Cairo, Egypt.
