A crisis is looming at the Garissa Refferal Hospital Mortuary after which has a capacity of 12 following an influx of bodies recovered dumped in River Tana. According to Dr. Ambrose Misori, the Medical Superintendent, 11 bodies that have yet to be identified were brought in three months ago. According to the hospital, almost all of the bodies showed signs of torture, with the majority of them having their feet and hands tied. The bodies have complicated the operations of the mortuary, which is concerned about what might happen if more bodies are taken for preservation. The hospital is in contact with the police and public health officials to arrange for the bodies’ disposal. Police in the two counties of Garissa and Tana River say it has been difficult to begin investigations into the identities of the 11 because no one has come out to record statements on missing persons. According to Ali Ndiema, Sub County Police Commander Tana North, police were unable to extract fingerprints from the bodies because they were badly decomposed.] He did, however, say that they took some samples and sent them to a government chemist for DNA analysis. He also urged members of the public who may have lost loved ones to report the incident to the nearest police station so that investigations could begin.
